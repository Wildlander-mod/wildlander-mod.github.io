## THERE IS NO TL;DR.

**Reading isn't Optional** We provide an extensive wiki which answers a lot of questions in detail. At the very minimum, the [Recommended Reading](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/02-RecommendedReading/0-Start-Here/) section should be read before starting.

This wiki also contains the getting started guide, plus all the mod list documentation relating to the new mechanics.
