  Steal something from the person of a named NPC 
* Steal something from the home of a named NPC 
* Murder a generic NPC generated by the missive. These can be citizens of towns, wandering travelers, and even members of certain factions such as the Vigilants of Stendarr or even the Dawnguard. (E.g the dark brotherhood didnt respond to my plea for help - so i’m coming to you instead)
* Item deliveries of a more unethical nature, such as poisons and skooma. 
* Deliver threatening letters. All the gold is given by the missive giver instead of half by them and half by the recipient. The recipient gives no reward and will respond to the letter with great fear. ""By the gods, this can't be happening\!"" or smth like that. And if it doesn't break anything, they could run around in fear for an hour or two.
*  Collect ingredients of a more nefarious nature. Human Hearts, human flesh, etc.
* A variant of the ""retrieve an artifact"" quest where the item being retrieved is clearly evil in nature, and the location could be anywhere from a dungeon to a Jarl's vault. The recipient for the item could range from the obvious (temporarily non-hostile) evil sort, to one of the court or college mages looking to acquire the item covertly.

WL-1850 - Thoughts on the humble backpack and how to improve it,Gameplay,Thoughts on the humble backpack and how to improve it,"So I have been playing wildlander for just shy a week now and something has crossed my mind. I wish there were more backpacks. Right now, as far as I have been able to find, there is only the singular fur backpack, which is easily acquired at the start of any playthrough from a general store or crafting. 

This makes the option of having one sort of redundant. If your only options are have a backpack and get the almost necessary boost to your carry weight or don't, it becomes a sort of non-option and instead just a busy work thing to tick off. I think a way to improve upon this system would be to add some variety unto this, adding in new types of backpacks, that either need to be crafted with high end skills, special recipes and merchants or even rewards. 

Have a backpack that carries less but boosts your rewards from hunting. Have one that boosts your expertise while picking locks. Have one that lets you gather more alchemical ingredients while out harvesting. Sky's the limit. I understand there is already a backpack mod in the AV upgrade to the game, but I assume including that would be much more a headache than worth. However, what does the community think?

Wall of frost, because its a hazard sprayed on the floor not a NPC cast effect means the Hazard element isn't affected by resistances correctly (engine bug). its also extremely high damage on its own 50/s.

Because mistmen attack in groups this means that you can be standing on 6 hazards stacked on top of one another taking 300 damage a second and regardless of your health - thats gonna kill you quickly.

",Investigated / Needs Decision,"This is caused by the shadow distance draw settings (e.g. the distance around your player shadow renders at). Imagine your character is at the center of a bubble - that bubble determines how far away shadows draw. Outside of that bubble, no shadows will render and given a theoretically infinite bubble size, the entire area would appear shaded. This bubble moves when your character moves.
The time of day is an “influence” in the sense that Wildlander uses DVLaSS (dynamic volumetric lighting and sun shadows), which allows the actual geography to cast shadows like in real life. So the entire area outside of your bubble is likely covered in shadow because the sun’s gone down behind the mountains, but you only see the shadows as far as the render distance is set.

WL-1765 - Suggestion for Barenziah's quest or Prowler's Profit effect ,Gameplay,Suggestion for Barenziah's quest or Prowler's Profit effect ,"I've been searching through the nexus and I didn't really find anything about this, so that's why I'm suggesting it here.I strongly believe No Stone Unturned to be the largest and most boring/underwelming quest of the whole game with its DLCs; you have to yes or yes go trough every primary questline (Main Quest, Thieves, Mages and Companions) to be able to finish it, and the reward you get is an insanely amount of gems that are mostly unnecessary by that point; you either will not be able to sell them all or you won't need the money by that moment..

So I thought it would be really interesting to either adding an extra effect to the Prowler's Profit buff, something useful related to the shady chars since it's related to the Thieves guild, or giving some effects for having X number of Stones... I don't know, like every 8 stones recovered will give you X% bonus to Sneak/Lockpick/Pickpocket or something like that.

I'm currently playing a thief and I'm at the point where I have to go to Mercer's house; the thing is, centering on doing thieves stuff, I'm at 54 in Sneak, which doesn't allow me to go unnoticed, which is curious when it would be logical to be able to do much of the content of these quests using stealth...

I can guarantee that the East Empire Company Warehouse part can't be completed unnoticed with 51 fully perked stealth + full light armor + walking sneak, and it's really hard to be on level 75+ by that moment (I don't know if that would help either) So having some extra help that would fit the role of the thieves would be nice, thus the Barenziah suggestion.Would it be out of place for Wildlander?",Investigated / Needs Decision,,Awaiting Lead Decision for resolution

WL-1890 - Telekinetic Alteration Spells Analysis,Gameplay,Telekinetic Alteration Spells Analysis,"I haven't seen much in googling, so I figured I'd drop a post here in case anyone is like me and wanted to know what telekinetic spells work on which enemies. After weeks (in real life) of levelling Alteration to Expert, I noticed Telekinetic Nova would work on some enemies, but not others, and the reasons why are not explained. I used SSEdit to look at the spell values and conditions. Below I also added some notes on these restrictions, their conflict with the desired realism of Wildlander and the underlying Requiem system. These notes were created in the hopes that the good people of Wildlander will read them and consider them while making the new update.

If my analysis is flawed, please let me know so that anyone reading this is properly informed and I am not pushing out bad info.

Telekinetic Nova will not work if:
- Enemy has more than 400 HP
- Enemy has more than 30% spell resistance
- Enemy is immune to Strong Unrelenting Force
Paralysis (mentioned as telekinetic in the description) will not work if:
- Enemy is a Dragon
- Enemy is immune to paralysis
- Enemy is a Ghost
- Enemy cannot be restrained (assumed, the value is GetRestrained = 0)
Telekinetic Disarray will not work if:
- Enemy level is greater than 40
- Enemy has greater than 33% resist magic
Telekinetic Blast will not work if:
- Enemy is immune to Strong Unrelenting Force
- Enemy has resist magic greater than 50%
Telekinetic Execution will not work if:
- Enemy is a Dragon or is of ""Dragon Race""
- Enemy is a Dwarven Centurion
- Enemy is a Wisp
- Enemy is a Wisp Shade
- Enemy is a Wisp Mother
- Enemy is ""Essence of Magicka""
- Enemy is an Ice Wraith
- Enemy is a Ghost
- Enemy has 50% resist magic

Cross-referencing these restrictions with the excellent Wildlander Bestiary Wiki, it becomes apparent that Expert and Master Telekinetic Alteration spells are ineffective against a significant portion of enemies, in some cases inconsistently.

Notes on Balance and Realism
Some enemies are vulnerable to telekinetic spells while being both immune to paralysis and other telekinetic spells (Ice wraiths for example). Paralysis is stated in the spell description: ""The caster tries to telekinetically imprison the target for <1> seconds."" The solution could be to separate poison-based paralysis from telekinetic-based paralysis.

More to the above, Dwemer Automatons should not be immune to paralysis. A mage using Alteration paralysis is using telekinesis to stop kinetic motion of an enemy. Unfortunately, the Requiem system treats poison-based paralysis and telekinetic-based paralysis the same.

No enemy that has immunity to Unreleting Force should be immune to telekinetic blasts. Unrelenting Force is a Draconic power, so it makes some sense that enemies like Dragur would be immune to said power for lore reasons. However, telekinetic Alteration magic does not rely on Draconic powers; it is the generation of force via the ""alteration"" of reality. This argument could be expanded to say any enemy not immune to physical attacks should not be immune to telekinetic blasts, but this argument would cause more balancing issues than it would solve.

Telekinetic Execution has so many exceptions to its effectiveness as to be an obvious attempt to hastily nerf it. This one is strange, as it is a Master level spell, and other Master level spells of other magical skill trees do not have this strange collection of specific restrictions. Some of the restrictions do not even make sense; an Ice Wraith that would be shattered by Telekinetic Nova is immune to Telekinetic Execution.

Telekinetic Disarray already has a restriction where an enemy's spell resistance can prevent its effectiveness. The level 40 restriction does not make sense; after achieving level 40, enemies acquire the supernatural ability to hold on to all of their armor and weapons, utterly confounding an expert alteration mage who is capable of shattering every bone in their body. An alteration mage that can telekinetically freeze a person is unable to remove said person's equipment.

WL-2012 - Various crafting feedback,Gameplay,Various crafting feedback,"Alchemy: 
self made potions are too inconvenient 

resist potions and fortify skill/stat potions should last longer:

I usually use these during tougher fights (e.g. dragon). Since resist potions only last 60s and it makes monitor the timer necessary. After burning a few times to death (duration ended -> 2x more dmg taken), I swithed to bought ones with 180-300s. These feel woth it. suggestion: Fortify weapon-skill 120s, sneak 300s, stats (Hp,Magic,Stam) 180s-300s and 2-4x effect 

Restore stat potions are too weak:
even with 90 alchemy, basic restore potions are only equal to merchants good/great quality. This feels underwhelming. With the last perk they get really useful. suggestion: move the 50% buff on restore potions from the last perk (purific. process) to the 2. perk (impr. elixirs) 

money making
no good solution comes to my mind. Some potions (restore) are to cheap, some are too expensive when crafted with the right ingredient (salmon roe). The decision, that mages don't trade potions is good.


Smithing/forging: 
Smithing makes too little money
the combination of investment (buying prices of ingredients),return (sell price) and the low carry weight makes it hard to earn money. To make 1k-2k gold you need to move multiple times between chest, merchant and forge - this is very inconvenient for the return you get. suggestion: lower the weight of fragments and ingots (when you scrap sth you only keep the ""good"" parts) by 1/3rd. This reduces dungeon trackback (to horse) or ""magic-chest"" usage. 

daedric weapons are a key goal for many players investing into smithing but are punishing light armor users.

suggestion: move daedric crafting into the middle, like dragon-crafting. Replace the requirement to have ebony smithing from Daedric and set it to ebony or glass) The ebony part requirements for making the items  are still fine with honed metal mod giving access to these items via crafters. 

some smithing perks feel unnecessary (e.g. nordic crafting).
Suggestion: Probably better taking the requiem 6.0 approach and moving the items from this perk to advanced Blacksmith 

Tempering feels too weak
suggestion: add a +5%-10% tempering bonus to every material smiting perk. 
",Investigated / Needs Decision,"Alchemy: 
Resist potions and fortify skill/stat potions should last longer:
Disagree. They last as long as the ingredients used to craft them. Want better potions - use better ingredients.

Restore stat potions are too weak:
Alchemy is already OP. Not making it stronger.

Money making
We already rebalanced this for r4. we will see what effects the changes have. 

Smithing/forging: 
Smithing makes too little money
I don't see what this suggestion does to improve the money aspect. Hopefully the forthcoming crafting missives will help with this aspect.

Daedric weapons are a key goal for many players investing into smithing but are punishing light armor users.
 
I disagree with removing the ebony perk when every recipe requires ebony to craft.

Some smithing perks feel unnecessary (e.g. nordic crafting).
Agree with this, we should do what 6.0 does and move the recipes to ""standard"" requiem perks. Then revert the changes to the perk trees. This will also save us time if we choose to upgrade to requiem 6.

Tempering feels too weak
i have no objections to increasing temper bonus a bit. but not 5-10%. Perhaps 2.5%

Summary:
The only part i really agree with here is some smithing perks feel unnecessary, and the temper bonus could be stronger .

added two patches to do the grunt work here.

WL-2024 - Master Level casting: Tiny Overview.,Gameplay,Master Level casting: Tiny Overview.,"Master level spells are without a doubt the most useless class of spells in the whole game, that are not illusion. 
- Slow to cast
- extremely high cost/usefulness ratio. Expert spells cost less, have more utility, and kill things just as quickly without depleting your resources to upkeep.
- you cannot move while casting most of them, and your aiming also becomes limited. This can be felt the most when casting master level necromancy, and your spell gets wasted because it didn't hit the corpses.

 Possible Solutions: 
- replace the master level spell animation with the regular charge animation that allows you to both move and pre-aim. This alone solves 80% of the issues.
- decrease the cost of master level spells or increase their magnitude.
- Nerf offensive destruction and alteration spells across the board to artificially make master level spells feel more powerful (and useful)

 As it stands, master level spells don't really have a place in standard play because they're not accessible to generalist builds and even when you purposely spec your character to be able to use them, they don't have the appropriate impact in the gameplay. They're cast by players not because they're useful, but because they can spare to do so.",Investigated / Needs Decision,I kinda agree with the animation point. the rest not so much.,Awaiting Lead Decision for resolution

First of all, I would like to thank the entire Wildlander team for their hard work. The modpack definitely has its own concept, style, and excellent implementation. Separately, I would like to thank you very much for the optimization on weak computers. 

Now about the bug: I am the owner of a monitor 16:10, with a resolution of 1920x1200, and faced with the following bug, which in no way can not solve myself: the wrong location of the interface elements on the screen. I'm pretty sure that the problem is not from my side: I've reinstalled the game and modpack several times, and finally solved the problem only when I changed my monitor to an older one with a 16:9 resolution. Apparently, the interface configuration for 1920x1200 resolution is simply missing. 

Separately, I note regarding the screenshot: it was not made by me, but it perfectly reflects what I see on the screen. I can not make my own screenshot for the aforementioned reasons - I have already changed my monitor and thus stopped the problem, but did not fix it. 

I can assume that the problem can be solved quite simply by manually specifying the coordinates of UI elements in Skyhud.txt, because that's where the settings get confused.

Actually, I would be very surprised if it turns out that the problem is exclusively on my side for some reason.

If you use the horse inventory hotkey, you will not be able to switch tabs to the player's inventory when using a controller and thus cannot transfer items to said horse using the controller.

To re-iterate, only the controller cannot switch to the player's inventory and vice versa. The keyboard can switch inventories just fine. If you don't use the horse inventory hot key and interact with the horse whilst sneaking to access the menu, and then use that to access the inventory, switching tabs on the controller will work.

 Additional Information 
I don't know... but I remember I talked to the priest when he was laying on the shrine of Namira, before they gave me the order to sacrifice him, so maybe that had something to do with the bug.

Lizzy’s thoughts:

{quote}basically when you talk to a smith who has lower skill than you - and try to get them to ""do"" something - it lowers your skill to match there's.

Sometimes - it doesn't clear that when you exit

the person i seen it happen to went to Adrienne for some tempering - they had 90 skill - and it dropped theirs to match hers. After they collected the item from her - they noticed they'd ""lost"" 60 skill

pretty sure its hm_actor.psc and something for whatever reason doesn't call modifySkillLevel on exit of honed metal to reset the players skill 

there might be a reset in the MCM somewhere to handle it - but i haven't had time to go take a look{quote}",Planned,,Planned for integration into R5

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UUhzqkX47-ph_bntVyherHCBY8KGSbbN/view?usp=sharing
its based off of this mod:
https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/k4jf8h/requiem_alchemy_enhancer_for_se_requiem_401/

- I bump the MCM alchemy exp rate up to 200% and alchemy leveling is in the ~100s gold value at low level to low 1000s gold value at high level.
- *The hunterborn alchemy ingredients are slightly overtuned and expensive, but i left them only slightly adjusted down as a way to be able to level alchemy quicker on demand.
- you could easily immersibly gate alchemy leveling behind hard-to-acquire ingredients that make slightly disproportionately expensive potions

But overall this mod significantly reduces the alchemy abuse on economy

I would even recommend allowing the exp multiplier to be 400% instead of the current max 200%, and then dial down the hunterborn potion values further

if you want i could try doing those things myself; getting the adjustments tuned/balanced well in my opinion and messaging the original mod author for their approval to clear the way for this to be on the possible inclusion list for Wildlander 🙂

Maybe reduce the spawning of them to only Dawnstar/Winterhold/Windhelm, or cut down the value a lot, or make them wear out with use quickly so you need to get new ones.

1. On the start of the brawl, I dont equip my fist. I ALWAYS equip a torch in the left hand and whatever I had in my right hand. (The UI shows fists for some reason). 
2. Brawls, that end with opponents health bar at 1/4, for example thiefes guild quest, trigger a bounty with the first hit after the fight. Their is no save zone, where you can still savely hit the other guy (since at least I smash my left button). 
3. This bug I can't reliable reproduce, but fights end somewhat regularly without actually bringing results. Either the other opponent doesnt acknowledge the win or the quest gets stuck.

*Steps to reproduce:*

The first bug is easy. Just start any brawl (the first that comes to my mind is with Uthgerd the Unbroken in Whiterun). Of course have a torch. The second bug is the start quest for the thieves guild the easiest way. Start the quest, threat one of the targets into a brawl. If you win the fight, the first hit will trigger a 500 bounty.

So, we settled on the idea for land surveys that can be purchased from merchants. They would be single-use items that would add a miscellaneous quest objective that points to the location of one or more ore veins of a specific type, that are not yet depleted. For example: 

Item Name: “The Rift Land Survey - Ore: Iron” 

Quest Objective: “Head to the ore deposit marked in 'The Rift Land Survey - Ore: Iron'”",Planned,"The notice Board has a quest to discover a undiscovered location on the map, shouldnt be too hard to retool this to ore.","Planned for integration into R5

WL-2032 - Vampire face neck seam issue ,Visuals,Vampire face neck seam issue ,So do all races suffer from this? I finally turned my Dunmer into a vampire lord and was really disappointed in how bad it makes the character look. From messed up textures on the chin area to the very obvious color discrepancy between the face and the body. It’s not just a player character problem either it seems. Both Dunmer npc vampires at castle Volkihar have the same issue. I switched over to my Breton and used the console to turn him into a vampire to test and it looks he’s got the same problem. There’s another post about this from about two years ago but not much solutions to go on. I was going to take this character further than my last one but the ugliness is too much lol. I’m just going to get the vampire achievement and trash the playthrough if there is no way to remedy this issue without opening showracemenu every time I feed or turn into a vampire lord (since that resets the character back to the ugly discoloration face and body)   ,Planned,"Can you take a look to make sure this issue is resolved with the changes we have made?

However, since mage armor 4 has a long duration by the time you have master spells, you cannot use mage armor 5, or you can't use mage armor 4. Essentially a master level spell is rendered fairly useless due to not either taking effect in addition to mage armor 4 or overriding it. I'd say it should stack since it is a different type of effect, armor vs Phys immunity, but so long as it takes effect it would be fine.

WL-1644 - [Follower]Formations break follower AI and make them unusable,Follower,[Follower]Formations break follower AI and make them unusable,"Formations are completely broken.  Please see the attached videos that showcase these issues.  All the clips except for the one in Bleak Falls Barrow were taken right after starting a new game (v1.1.11) and hiring mercenaries, which I did to make sure that it's not just my current save that may have gone kaput.

- Followers are exclusively and singularly focused on one task: to remain in their formation position, no matter what, even if they are taking hits until they die.  
- Followers will not use their bows, ever, while in formation.  Often times they equip their bow and keep drawing it over and over again, without ever firing.  
- Most of the time followers will not engage the enemy even in close quarter melee combat.  They just stand around soaking hits from the enemy.  
- Followers will spam many health potions within 1 second
- Followers will not form the correct formation shape

All these issues are intermittent but extremely frequent.  Also, keep in mind my previous report where I pointed out that I have no way of turning off formations, which compounds the issues.  (I can only tell each individual follower to ignore formations for a short time until I use the Wait/Follow command and they fall back into formation again, which is not practical and extremely tedious.  I think the ""Formations"" hotkey menu should have an option to turn off formations for all followers permanently).
My followers are unusable at this point and I am forced to abandon them.  
I wish there was a way to somehow disable formations permanently and never look back (console maybe?).  My character build revolves around using followers and I would like to salvage it somehow.  

I hope this follower system mod will be dropped for good, whether or not it gets replaced with a better one.  Even vanilla follower AI is better than this.

WL-1612 - Keywords on equipment resulting in incorrect tempering values,Crafting,Keywords on equipment resulting in incorrect tempering values,"Looking through SSEEdit a number of equipment items / types have a large number of additional keywords which allows for them to gain the benefit of multiple tempering perks unintentionally. OR the Smithing perks have far too many conditions on them, allowing them to overlap on equipment (see Craftmanship and Scale Armor Perks for example). See Scale armour for an example, it has a number of additional keywords that are also used in the perk conditions within Smithing, creating a lot of overlap, so that by the time you can craft Elven gear (Elven Smithing ONLY increases Elven tempering) it's already worse than Scale.

I would advise removing addition and unneeded keywords from items so that they fit within a specific group or be more specific withing the smithing perks to prevent duplicate impacts. Even creating specific smithing perk keywords and only using those (as Requiem originally used).

WL-1609 - Frost’s fancy armor disappears after entering whiterun ,Horse,Frost’s fancy armor disappears after entering whiterun ,"I loaded up my game, and the fancy armor that Frost comes with was missing. Naked horse. 

I loaded a few saves back to where the horse had armor, and I can go in and out of other places, and the horse still is wearing the armor when I come out. So I get back to Whiterun, WITH the armor, and I save game, looking at the armored horse. 

Save and load; still armored. Cool. 

Thinking maybe some script or something needed time to load into the game, I loaded the original game where Frost had become unarmored, and snack to naked. 

Here’s where it gets weird: I loaded the game with the armored Frost that I had just re-saved and verified while looking and saving, and the armor was now missing in *that* save as well, even though the save screen clearly has the horse in the armor. 

Anyway, seems like a bug. I fiddled with it a bit by trying to put a cheap saddle on instead, but rather than swapping saddles/armors (giving me the option to see frosts equipped armor as an inventory item) it just “equipped” the cheap saddle, with Frost still looking heavily armored. When I unequip the cheap saddle, frost then becomes naked. 

That’s about as detailed as I can be, hopefully I explained it okay and it makes sense. In the grand scheme it’s no biggie, (considering frost is a rad horse, the quest isn’t *that* hard, and that armor is really expensive) but I thought the team might want to know. 

This reminds me a lot of what happens with Fallout 4 and Paladin Danse’s power armor being buggy. It t doesn’t show in his inventory, and if you try to put new armor on him it screws everything up, messing with his weight etc. apparently it counts as invisible armor in some unused armor slot that modders like to use. Anyway, just my 2¢
*Additional Information*
Go get frost, race straight back to Whiterun, set up a camp right outside the first gate as closr where it’ll accept a tent/barrel/campfire, go into whiterun, sell a bunch of stuff to belethor, go back outside (look at the horse here, it may have already lost its armor at this step), save and quit. Load game and the armor should be gone. 

Not sure what I could screenshot that would be helpful.
",Testing,"This is the fault of the Adopt and inventory scripts in IHOConfigMenuScript.
 
In both cases they check the horse’s base reference to see if the horses default outfit is “bareback” and if its not, change it to bareback. The problem is - after doing this, it doesnt re-equip the saddle - It just adds it to the inventory.

Followers will not follow you through that area, and will sprint to enter the nearest building while you are in it. 

Some findings
- Followers seem to ignore the blind spot when they are in formation.
- This occurs for every follower in a group of followers, tried with up to three.
- If you go across the area by the boardwalk, followers will instead go all the way around and run aboard the ship in the middle.
- Captain Wayfinder can't find his way out of Silus Vesuius' House, I'm guessing due to his path going through this area and he instead runs inside the house. Verified by dialogue-porting him outside and shoving him across The Zone, after which he could successfully pathfind back to his ship.
- Guards will avoid this area as well, instead turning back and patrolling in the other direction.


*Additional Information*
Get a follower and go to Dawnstar.
Get to the lower part of town, where the water is.
Walk towards the Dawnstar Museum using the boardwalk. (keep an eye on your follower)
As you cross the path going to The Mortar and Pestle and approach Beitild's House, your follower will start sprinting towards the shop.
When you quickly leave ""The Zone"" from the other side, your follower will run all the way around and try to get on the ship.

26 June 2022, 12:28PM My guess is something to do with clipping with an npc or possibly sitting on a navmesh, the navmesh idea seems like it might be possible seeing as just before getting into this Farmhouse01 reference it mentions BGSProcedureTravelExecState, I get a similar crash going through doors every now and then which I believe has something to do with npc placement, namely followers in this case as several times I've noticed one of my followers actually stuck behind the door instead of in front of it, even at Whiterun main gates I've seen this happen, sometimes they get stuck behind the door, other times it crashes, and other times nothing is amiss, that's my best observation, although I've also gotten this crash on the road around Nightgate and up the Helgen road toward Bloodlet Throne so idk, I can say in the CK view I noticed at least somewhere on the Rorikstead road that a road spawn marker and predator spawn were on top of each other, also when running through checking this with the AI disabled I had a sabrecat and horse spawn in the exact same spot and spaz out vying for space, if I recall that crashed as well so seems like it could be that but no real proof.

To remedy this, HM offers a configuration file under Data/SKSE/plugins/ called HonedMetal.ini where you can define the perk ids of whichever perk you don't want the mod to use and it will be blacklisted.

",Testing,"This is because the companion is quest enforced (e.g. Farkas follows you for proving honor and he wont go away til you complete it)

When you come to dismiss them - the dialog script FLP runs cant tell them to go home, because they are not a FLP follower, but instead in the vanilla slot which FLP doesn't touch.

When playing on a normal requiem build (either other modlists or my own modlist) the sprinting power has no recharge time, one of the main ways of fighting a dragon for an example is to sprint power attack it nonstop (if you have the stamina for it ofc) while going back and fourth to avoid getting hit as much as possible. in Wildlander this is not possible, because once you have SPA (sprinted power attacked) once, you can't do it again for at least 0.75 seconds, you can see in the video i am pressing and holding the left mouse button but my character always will normal attack after a sprinting attack. this is much more noticeable in two handed for some reason.

WL-1888 - Campfire cookpot not working. ,Gameplay,Campfire cookpot not working. ,build largest campfire. still too small to cook with.,Testing,"Issue is because you cant cook with a campfire cookpot until it reloads to ""show the stew"". 

This doesn't happen immediately after placing it (and if you use it too quickly it will never swap out).

my personal recommendation for this would be to disable campfire cookpots for https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101233. This has built in campfire compatibility using form list manipulator (https://airtable.com/app6IMUkhDQiSdL0B/tbln0wE3ffVnUk2ML/viwXmGCMdwxWGlCSH/recGFZAMaCGhNxgNQ?blocks=hide) which is already flagged for r4 inclusion

Especially if Player crafting isn't going to be available (which is the current work around for this issue) 

_________________________________________________

Patch created which

1) Disables Campfire cookpots recipe
2) Disabled Simple portable cooking Alchemy mortar recipe
3) Added breakdown for new cookpot
4) replace Campfire with New cookpot in levelled lists
5) Replace Campfire with new cookpot in Switch recipes on Iron Pots.
6) Standardized Editor ID's

Notes:

Have tested with replacing the cookpot on the backpack - and while it detects the presence of the new cookpots and adds them - they have different models to the one used by this mod. Instead we will need to use the Immersive equipment display preset provided, but i'm not sure if this can be deployed to be autoloaded on a new game

Cookpot needs to be used from the inventory, rather than placed from the campfire menu then manually activated.

Has been updated with description framework - so no changes  needed on that front!

This mod wont show a cookpot on your backpack by default but it does have IED Nodes that we can merge into the default profile.
To get started, download the mod and install one, or more, of the available files. After you load the game, open up IED's UI.
1. Navigate to ""View>Variables"", select the presets available from the dropdown menu and click on merge.
2. Then navigate to ""View>Display manager>View>Custom items, choose where you want to apply the preset, select the preset available from the dropdown menu and click on merge
3. Export the profile. (this will create in overwrite) i believe you just need to include file this in a Mod for deployment.

Install 
1. Formlist manipulator https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037  (to add the campfire variants from campfire to the list of approved cooking sources) I KNOW YOU LIKE MANUALLY CONTROLLING THESE formlists - But this mod makes compatibility easy AF.
2. Simple portable cooking. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101233


Load all of that before wildlander then merge my patch in.

WL-1922 - Add ability to control backpacks Via IED,Mod Addition,Add ability to control backpacks Via IED,"One of the common support questions i get asked is how to reposition the backpack so it doesn't clip with cloaks or shields.

IED isn't currently aware of backpacks - so the only advise i can give is to unequip the backpack and console in the carry weight.

though a new mod it is now possible to expose the campfire backpack to IED.
https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100113

2. Then navigate to ""View>Display manager>View>Custom items, choose where you want to apply the preset, select the preset available from the dropdown menu and click on merge
3. Export the Profile 

From what I've gathered from the mod posts,  (File -> Default config -> Export). This should, in theory, create a
SKSE\Plugins\IED\DefaultConfigUser.json
file, which could be used to auto-apply the 'preset' with this setup for new games. (this would probably be in overwrite for us)

we should obviously check this is the case. if it is distribute our preset in the wildlander folder.

WL-1975 - Poison dragon breath is irresistable,Combat,Poison dragon breath is irresistable,"So my second dragon, the one in kynesgrove, is of the poison variety.
I've learned that its breath attack is not mitigated by anything. It's 50 damage per second for ~3 seconds and then the damage drops sharply to ~7 and then drops gradually for the last 3 seconds (the wiki is wrong here). I'd put the overall damage at around 185.
With 100% poison resist the poison bite damage over time is reduced to 0, but it has no effect on the poison breath. Neither does 90% magic/frost/fire/shock resistance. The perk that is supposed to halve damage from shouts also does nothing (I had to run back to the greybeards to take that one). I even tried 100% disease resist and that does nothing too. Nor does immunity to drain attacks from fortify health enchants. If I switch my armor for robes the damage is the same.
I can tank one hit, but he can use it 2-3 times in a row even in melee range. I'm heavy armor sword and board, so dodging it is basically a no-go, and I can't tell if he's about to bite (easily blocked) or shout (not resisted by anything). Am I supposed to just have 500 health or a backpack full of superlative health potions?

I can send you my save file or screenshots of what I'm describing, it's very easy to reproduce. Take the full blast from one vile vapor with 90% poison resist (my values are coming from the requiem skills menu) and it will deal ~180 damage. Reload and console in and drink a potion of cleansing to reduce poison resistance to 0% and take the same blast and it will deal the same damage. Do it again without the shout resistance perk, the damage is the same, plus or minus a few HP. Magic tab clearly shows the duration as 6s, but if you re-enter the menu during the last 4s you'll see lower values than 50 for damage.

I'd say this is a bug.",Testing,"Firstly i did identify that the magic effect has correct resistances setup - however from the provided video's it appears that it has similar issues to the Environmental hazards from Wall of.. with the resistances not applying.

Mod author here, I actually finally found the cause of that teleport bug somewhat recently.
If your character enters an space through one load door, then exits through a different one, and then plays an idle animation, this bug will happen where the game will get confused on where you are and teleport you back to the space you just left.
As far as I know there isn't a fix for this (apart from just never playing idle animations), and it's fairly minor, but if you want to avoid doing it just do your research/composing in a new space, and try to leave areas the same way you came in where it's reasonable.

WL-1590 - Unarmed range is too short to hit Falmer and Trolls,Gameplay,Unarmed range is too short to hit Falmer and Trolls,"Type of Bug: Gameplay
 Detailed Description 
Ultra Graphics

When fighting Falmer, Trolls, summoned Ghost Trolls, and probably other unshapely creatures, Unarmed strikes cannot hit the target if you're face-to-face (This is important).

Attacking these creatures from behind, or while they are ragdolled/knocked down allows the punches to connect and properly damage the enemy.

This seems to be caused by weird Bethesda(TM) jank in regards to those particular enemies' hitboxes and hurtboxes, and the problem arises with Requiem's changes to weapon reach. (A quick search suggests that Unarmed has lower reach than daggers)

The only confirmation of the problem I found was this ancient Reddit post on the Requiem sub. 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/4j63v4/cant_hit_trolls_and_falmers_in_front/
-
It describes the exact same problem I'm experiencing, but I suppose the issue went overlooked by the Requiem developers due to how infrequently players attempt to use Unarmed.

If it matters, I'm playing a Khajiit Male, on the larger side of the size and height sliders.

WL-1589 -  Wooden Barrel/Wooden Chest can softlock all your controls,Gameplay, Wooden Barrel/Wooden Chest can softlock all your controls,"If you left-click a wooden barrel/wooden chest to enter it into spawning mode, but you press spacebar before it auto-closes your inventory gui, it places you into barrel/chest spawning mode like normal, but softlocks ALL your crucial keys. You cannot press E to open the gui to put the barrel/chest down nor cancel its placement. You cannot jump. You cannot move. You cannot access inventory. You cannot SAVE\! You cannot even hit escape to access the game's pause menu\! The only things I was able to do during this consistently repeated softlock were to turn my lantern on and off with L and use my mouse1 and mouse2 to draw my crossbow, fire it, and bash the ground I was standing on. 

The only way out of this softlock is to tab out, open task manager, and kill the game manually from there. 

How I found this glitch:

I use my 'Wonderbarrel', as I call, it for tedious but infinite inventory space, and it's an absolutely crucial part of my playthrough as weight/inventory management is the biggest hurdle I face with my packrat playstyle. When spawning my Wonderbarrel though, I am almost always stuck inside a phantom version of it that locks my movement and I must jump to get out of this invisible barrel and move around to get a better placement, or sometimes as a mandatory fix just to get the 'Place Here' prompt to actually show up on my screen. After LOTS of use with this janky barrel, I began to get into the groove of jumping right after I select the barrel to get unstuck from the phantom barrel placed inside me as the Wooden Barrel select-spawn-spot state is activated. I eventually got so comfortable with this annoying pattern that I did it too fast, and ended up hitting space before the barrel spawning mode state actually began. I lost 20 minutes of progress as I could not save or get out of this state. 
(Side bug note on this: using the Wooden Barrel in an area with a low ceiling, such as the docks entrance to the Ratways in Riften can result in a different sort of softlock where the low ceiling somehow messes with the phantom barrel that makes the 'Place Here' prompt appear at all and never shows up even though the teal placeholder barrel hologram is still visible and moving. This forces a reload or console commands to escape the spawning-mode player state because the 'Place Here' prompt never shows up no matter which angle or movement keys you try.) 

No, but please for the love of God just cut out the middleman with mobile inventory items and ditch the janky buggy ""Place here"" system if at all possible. Just make these items open a container when clicked on from inventory... or better yet, just have them auto-placed inside of you and have no collisions so players/npcs can walk right through them but they still act as containers to be picked up and set down. I've opened my Wonderbarrel hundreds of times by now, and the stupid ""Place here to make it a real object for extra immersion lol"" gimmick got so old so fast... if there's ANY better way to implement inventory-extension features like Wooden Chest/Wooden Barrel, I'm begging you guys as a packrat player-type, put that somewhere on your priority list for the next or next-next major update. I am not sure but I think Deep Storage the Alteration spell is from Wintersun (or at least it's Legendary Edition predecessor variant), and was so sad to see it get beat out by religion expansion in the poll. I'd take an annoying 5-second spell cast animation over my Wonderbarrel's horrific jank any day of the week. 
*Additional Information*
Left-click on a Wooden Barrel or Wooden Chest item in your inventory, then immediately hit the spacebar. Make sure to do it fast enough that you hit space BEFORE your inventory window is force-closed by the Wooden Barrel spawn-in script(s). 

Works anywhere, not location-related, nor would screenshots of a teal barrel be very helpful.

For unknown reasons, it just suddenly started. Then what I did is give up this specific build and i removeperk some twohanded and put em in onehanded and continued playing with dual bound swords which worked fine. Then a few levels later i tested the bound axe and now it worked fine.. so I reloaded the old save where the problem was happening.. and it was fine now. So I played a couple minutes, spawned a few battleaxes, killed stuff, then I spawned a spectral warhound and suddenly the problem started again. If I reload the game while the bugged spawned axe is in my hand, after the reload it appears and its fine. But if i try to spawn another, its the same problem. Maybe its the spectral warhound that breaks it but I cant reproduce it and besides, I played with those two skills before this started. This is all I can tell you.

Not sure) and found a way to continue casting even when empty on magicka by draining the bar fully then start recasting around half way filled. The bar will drain normally but I can continue casting even once its empty as long as I keep holding click. At the time I had the debuff from too much instant training and my magicka was lowered to about 75 or 50. As I said I haven't tried replicating with other spells or other training areas.

WL-1791 - Spell research (Feedback),Gameplay,Spell research (Feedback),"Hey guys, I have been having an amazing time in Wildlander so far. It's been such a blast that I even decided to play two different characters back to back! The second one is a mage, and so I wanted to really get into Spell Research, but after playing for a few days I think it's got a few unfortunate issues and I'm not sure how fixable they are in the context of Wildlander. Maybe you guys can help me see things from another perspective or have solutions I hadn't thought of, but here's what's irked me about it so far (Adept level mage of all schools at the moment):

The systems seem kind of divided, not very intertwined, and also kind of prohibitively difficult to get into.
The best example is that after hours of doing spell research, I didn't need to study or break down any of my dozens of enchanted weapon parts I found, I want to look into the ancient texts but I don't have the translation manuals and those are as far as I can tell just lucky drops, and I haven't even known about the solutions system until a guide was brought up that told me about it. It's a lot of systems that all seem to play into the same core functionality, but they don't seem necessary to do at all, and I think that's a bit of a shame.

The flavor text is pretty unhelpful and sometimes just misleading.
Gonna be honest, even after hours of interacting with Spell Research, its mechanics did not become obvious to me until after a friend watching me play read a guide and told them to me. And it's not like the system helps you out here, in fact it sometimes actively deceives you. ""Fatal flaws in the thesis"" I don't think means that the thesis is bad, in fact theses have no quality whatsoever, right? It's instead that you're missing XP, which...

You have to look up your research XP in the mod config.
That's like 12 slow-changing pages of archetypes to look through, with hundreds of values that might be irrelevant to what you're doing, because they don't really translate into a spell that is researchable. Some system that lets you peruse your research results more concisely could be good, I think, because right now it's just menu-hopping between mod config and inventory/magic tabs.

The archetypes are a bit too granular for how few spells there are.
I really think you should be able to learn a new spell with way fewer theses for archetypes than you currently do. This doesn't mean that you should add in more spells, if this is the amount of spells that is intended then that's that, but then I think you shouldn't need these very high amounts of XP in all these archetypes. You have to research so many archetypes to have a shot at getting a new spell, and that requires knowing a ton of spells at that level already. At that point, the list of spells you could feasibly research is quite slim, and for someone who doesn't want to look up what the choices even are, that seems kind of problematic, because...

The system seems unnecessarily punishing and for the wrong reasons.
When I initially saw this mod, I thought it would be awesome to experiment and just get some spells I didn't initially think of. But if you do that, you'll just be wasting food, drink, hours of your life and months in Skyrim because of missing XP, random fail chance, or just straight up searching for potential spells that just don't exist. Having to look into a cheat sheet to make sure you're not wasting your time, IDK, that takes away a lot, and makes it a lot more tedium than experimentation. I don't really mind being punished for doing something wrong and understanding why. When you die from cold, you know that you didn't bring warm clothes or just made bad preparations, and the types of preparations you can make seem very straightforward. In fact there isn't much ""you're just not good enough for this"" in the survival department. A beginner survivor could dress up warm, bring food, bring tea, head out being comfortably heated by fire, and then go straight from Whiterun to Dawnstar, recharge there, and head to Winterhold from there. This is not at all the case with Spell Research. A lot of the time, you fail and you didn't know what you did wrong.

Spell Research can't be used to help you break into a new spell difficulty.
Since archetype XP is tiered by spell difficulty, its only function is to pick up spells of the difficulty you're currently on or below. A lot of spells in this are tiered as well, so that the utility of doing this isn't actually very meaningful. You don't need Mage Armor 1 if you already have Mage Armor 2. This is a huge shame, because the system is so involved that it should probably be semi-mandatory, and not supplemental forever before becoming kinda required for harder to get master-level stuff (I don't know, I'm not there yet, but that's my assumption going in) The worst part about this situation is that it doesn't really matter that it can't be used to actually advance your mage progression, because Requiem just gives you spells along with the perks, and maybe RNG court wizards and College members just give you the rest that you might want to use. Buying these tomes makes the list of spells you can feasibly design with Spell Research even slimmer, which is bad for some of the aforementioned reasons.

Immersive? Maybe. Repetitive? Very.
Clearly research taking a long time is well-communicated in this mod, but I don't know that it actually translates very well into an engaging gameplay experience. In fact, a lot of the time I find myself researching in front of my bed for the better part of a day, eating and drinking when necessary, going to bed, filling up the needs, and repeat. There's no gameplay loop here, it's just menu-browsing, skill-spamming, refreshing your food and stuff, and doing that until you got what you wanted. I like that you can do that, but I hate doing it, and I wish you could do this stuff faster, but then maybe hitting a roadblock and having to go adventure for a bit, maybe finding a eureka moment via some of the gear they added and using that to push your research to new heights. Most of my enchanted tomes I can't read yet, and breaking down enchanted weapon pieces gives you a really unimpactful amount of XP.

I think the mod would be way more enjoyable in the context of Wildlander if it were somewhat more required, less granular, less repetitive, and if experimental attempts were both less punishing and would lead to clues about which direction to progress if not in the one you currently were. I don't know, is that unreasonable?",Backlog,,Awaiting Assessment

WL-1792 - Mage guild (Feedback),Gameplay,Mage guild (Feedback),"Overall, it's probably the time I've been the most conservative & cautious, and fucking thanks I was, because I know for sure some parts I just couldn't have succeeded.
There are a few things I'd like to comment, I'll use the spoiler tag just in case:

- Enchanted Spheres are hard as fuck, I think they're harder than ever; given a moment, I had two Storm Thralls on the one in Blackreach, and I was casting Lighting bolts... around 25%, we weren't able to outdamage its regen... it was insane.

- Most rewards are just worthless; by the time you get them, your equip surpass any of those.

- I really, REALLY love what you made with the Arch-Mage's chambers. However there are a few ""problems"" that could be easily solved, i.e. there's almost nothing to store good items, I mean, there are very few display cases, and they're already used; also, it would be nice to have some special display cases for special unique items, like Saarthal Amulet and so. The council room could use some display weapon racks on the walls, and the lab room has an ""Alchemy locker"", but not an ""Enchanting locker"" or something like that. Yes, I'm aware of the other room, the one with lotta chests, but I take you get my point.

- Something I don't understand, when you become the Arch-Mage you get access to everything, also of course Ancano's quarters; however, despite he being a traitor and being dead, his stuff, including some incriminating stuff like the Midden's key or the letter, everything is marked as ""stolen"" if you try to pick it.

- After becoming the Arch-Mage, all the Storm Thralls guarding the College are almost invisible; they're there, but like only 10% visible... is very annoying.

That's pretty much all, no big deals/issues, just a few things I felt weren't right.

EDIT there's another thing that bugs me a lot, and it's the ""non an active quest"" thing; The missing apprentices, for instance, I found them, got the rings, summoned the daedra and dealt with it, finishing it for good, but it never triggered any quest, and yet the same dialog about the missing apprentices appears with Phinis everytime after having finished this ""non-quest"".",Backlog,,Awaiting Assessment

During Battle For Whiterun (Stormcloak version), upon defeating Bulgruf and Irileif, Balgruf is meant to surrender, and Vignar Grey-Mane should enter Dragonsreach, prompting an argument between the two men. In my case, Vignar walked in, and then immediately walked out and went about his day, causing the quest to break. Reloading the quest to when it started did not work.

Using 'setstage CWSiegeObj 9000', I was able to complete the quest, but Ralof and Galmar kept following me, even after I used 'resetai' on them. After reloading to the broken objective and using 'setstage CWSiegeObj 9000' about 10-20 times to complete the quest, I was able to finally get them to stop.

Whereas discord moderators (understandably) believed this to be related to general CW jankiness, there are a couple things that point to this being an issue with the modlist.

1. The unoficial Skyrim wiki lists the following objectives for the quest:
""Objective 1000: Get your Orders from Galmar Stone-Fist
Objective 1005: Break through the Enemy Barricade
Objective 1015: Follow Galmar Stone-Fist
Objective 1020: Open the Exterior Gate
Objective 1030: Open the Drawbridge
Objective 1050: Enter Whiterun
Objective 1060: Break through the First Barricade
Objective 1070: Break through the Second Barricade
Objective 1080: Break through the Final Barricade
Objective 1200: Force Jarl Balgruuf the Greater to surrender
Objective 1210: Accept Jarl Balgruuf the Greater's surrender""

However, running the command 'player.sqs CWSiegeObj' (show quest objectives) shows most of these have been removed, despite still being present in terms of gameplay (i.e. they don't show in console, but you still need to do them, and all except 1210 worked fine for me).

2. When looking at CWSiegeAttackObj/ CWSiegeObj (the quest) in SSEdit (formIDs 0004E857, 00096E71), I can see its being referenced by Wildlander.esp, challenging the discord moderator statement that ""Civil War isn't touched by Wildlander"".

Whereas there's a good chance the mods are correct, and this is genuinly just vanilla Skyrim being awful, I'd suggest they be less dismissive of issues prior to investigating; this bug was gamebreaking, and took around 40 minutes to fix via console commands, and if it is caused by Wildlander changes, it should be fixed.



N/A, from conversations with other users this appears to be intermittent. Sucks to investigate I know.
",Currently Unsolvable,"Wildlander itself does not touch 0004E857 or 00096E71 - Only Ussep does. The only CW quest we even look at is the main civil war quest and the only thing we change it the reward

When I open the Magic menu, the cost of any spell is X. If I then open the Skills menu, leave the menu, then go back to Magic the spell cost is ~X/2. The values are wildly different. I think this is a bug and not some nuance of game mechanics because when the magic menu says the cost of Healing Aura on Self is 66, I cannot afford it with a full magic pool of 140. If I open the Magic menu again, the cost will appear as 155 Magic, which exceeds my pool. This happens under any circumstances and in any location I've tried.

 Detailed Description 
Ultra Graphics


crafting orders that are a staggeringly high number of items (such as many hundreds of arrows) can result in the vendor taking the player's money upon them picking up their order, but the player won't receive the items.

I suspect this is caused by the sheer number of gold being deposited into the vendor's gold count causing some sort of strange glitch where it simply takes your gold, but fails to deliver the ordered item(s) nor does it deposit the gold you just paid into the vendor's gold count.

Upon picking up the order, you will be charged, but some or all of the items will not land in your inventory as they should, nor will the appropriate amount of gold (ranging in the tens of thousands to even 100,000+ gold) land in the vendor's gold count to then be sold back.

--",Currently Unsolvable,"A (rare) Engine issue i believe. Spells only stop casting if your magic reaches Exactly zero. Every second it takes the cost from your magic, but it cant send it negative. 

If you have 101 magic and your spell costs 10 per second - it would tick down until you have 1 magic - if a the next tick would take your magic negative E.g -9 - it wouldn't consume the magic magic or send it negative. 

If the player doesn't have any ""in combat"" magic regen to force it back up to 10 magic - this leads the player to be able to constantly channel a spell at 1 magicka permanently.
