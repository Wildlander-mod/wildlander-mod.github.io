This Page was intended to be a reference guide to enable the player to be able to work out how the heck to kill some things in Wildlander. It Kinda grew from there to include all sorts of reference material from Requiem so that players wouldn't have to go look up a billion & one perks, spells and the like to work out what the enemies were shooting at them. 

This guide is broken up into several sections -  Bandits / Mages / Forsworn / Necromancers will not be covered in the guide (with the exception to the Named Unique bosses) as there are far to many varieties to list, all of which have different perks, weapons, armor. The next section contains reference material to identify weaknesses of the armor specific human type enemies can do and the weapons they use.

Vampires Will be covered, but not in-depth as like bandits they have a lot of variations of Armor, weapons and base stats.

Ghosts and Dragur will only be in summary form for the various types. They will not have detailed breakdowns as various types of these NPC all look the same, but have differing stats. 

## Humanoid Enemies 

For enemies wearing standard armor, and therefore with standard resistances you can check the armor guide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rMVLVouumU45jFfmjmWUVjTYY7_wLnrxwmHMi24R9OU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a> 

For enemies weapons and arrows you can check the weapon guide <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xp1LE79R4uHC2yP7KkA2p1sS-l_TkaRAQfdHV4t0aOM/edit#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" aria-labelledby="svg-external-link-title" width="1em" height="1em"><use xlink:href="#svg-external-link"></use></svg></a>

For the Afflicted, the only difference between a Bandit and them is the addition of the Poisonous Breath ability - This brutally painful poison deals 50 damage for 2 seconds.
