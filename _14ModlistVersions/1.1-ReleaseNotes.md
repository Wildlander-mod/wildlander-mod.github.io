| Key | Summary | Resolution | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WL-1142 | NPC hammering on fresh air! | Disabled Lantern | Animation |
| WL-1100 | Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine - crashes on engine update | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Animation |
| WL-913 | Guards enter dialogue and interrupt when using forge or other objects | Solution: Shifted the idle marker over to the other side of the crane | Animation |
| WL-912 | Guards comment negatively when training at the range...eg" don't do that", "Stop it" Please fix it for immersion | Solution: Shifted the idle marker over to the other side of the crane | Animation |
| WL-910 | The gold a npc adds to their inventory after you train at them is not accessible for trade with the player | Solution: Shifted the idle marker over to the other side of the crane | Animation |
| WL-909 | Fort dawnguard dogs can be greeted or intimidated to hand over valuables. | Solution: Shifted the idle marker over to the other side of the crane | Animation |
| WL-907 | Sybille Stentor only pays close to nothing for any item regardless of value. | Solution: Shifted the idle marker over to the other side of the crane | Animation |
| WL-901 | In Riftern, around forge, theres a guy hammering the air | Solution: Shifted the idle marker over to the other side of the crane | Animation |
| WL-793 | Followers are fleeing. See if we can't prevent the flee behavior from engaging, or at least see what's causing it | The issue appears to have been caused by Requiem’s True Yield (combat fear) effect being applied to followers. I have added a condition to each of the two effects that ensures the subject is not in the CurrentFollowerFaction. | Animation |
| WL-792 | M'aiq seems to be sprinting from place to place | I think this may be happening because AI Overhaul is overriding his wander package with some weird shit. I have tried reverting the wander package to vanilla, to see if that changes his behavior. | Animation |
| WL-777 | faralda in the arcaneum & Ralis Sedarys the first time meeting him (i had to detect aura to find him) | Removed erroneous idle marker in Arcaneaeaeaeum, adjusted idle markers near Kolbjorn Barrow so they’re not in the ground | Animation |
| WL-858 | Audio Overhaul Skyrim - Immersive Sounds Patch not carried over to Wildlander.esp | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Audio |
| WL-438 | Chirping birds heard inside the Stumbling Sabrecat inn. | the “wilderness interior day loop” from Sounds of Skyrim had the annoying 5 second bird loop. This has been nullified in the sound marker. | Audio |
| WL-1288 | Northwatch keep habour - Overgown | Disabled tree | Clipping |
| WL-1253 | Irnskar ironhand having a conversatiuon from inside of a tree. | Moved Tree back closer to the wall | Clipping |
| WL-1164 | Barbas gets stuck on a tree just outside of Falkreath and can't progress the quest | Deleted tree | Clipping |
| WL-1163 | Toolkits missing breakdown recipes | Deleted tree | Clipping |
| WL-1161 | Master locked safe in Markarth isn't marked as owned | Deleted tree | Clipping |
| WL-1159 | Random fire in the middle of Proudspire manor | Deleted tree | Clipping |
| WL-1158 | bulk recipes for fragments to ingots | Deleted tree | Clipping |
| WL-1155 | Laundry clipping with tree - Darkwater crossing | Deleted tree | Clipping |
| WL-1148 | Floating tree in solitude (next to imperial Alehouse) | Moved Tree | Clipping |
| WL-1144 | Happy little Floating tree next to windpeak Inn | Moved trees so they are in the floor | Clipping |
| WL-1127 | Solitude -Tree growing our of left side of archway (both front and back - two trees) | Disabled Trees | Clipping |
| WL-968 | Short male hairstyles clip with neck | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | Clipping |
| WL-961 | Fort Hraggstad's outside trap door of the collapsed tower to the right. | Removed Tree from House | Clipping |
| WL-945 | Basil's house in Riverwood has multiple trees clipping through it | Removed Tree from House | Clipping |
| WL-860 | There is no Abandoned Wolf Den, only a hole in the ground without any items. | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Clipping |
| WL-768 | Bloodskal Barrow word wall not working | worked for me! | Clipping |
| WL-703 | Can't gather firewood through camping mods. Hunterborn Forage can gather edibles, ingredients, and bones, but will only pass time when selecting the "firewood" forage option and will never give firewood items when generally foraging. | For some reason, Hunterborn’s tree scanning properties were not assigned. Restoring them has allowed the wood foraging to function as normal; it is possible again to get wood, deadwood, and tree bark from the trees. | Clipping |
| WL-546 | At Heartwood Mill (west of Riften), when you enter the mill the door you enter through is not interactable to get back out. Instead, there's a door on the opposite wall that you must exit through. | Landscape and Water Fixes adjusted the location, which was being overwritten by Requiem. Forwarded proper location | Clipping |
| WL-489 | Tree going through some kind of overhang in Riverwood. Behind the Sleeping Giant Inn. | Removed tree from Goat pen | Clipping |
| WL-476 | FalkreathTree growing into Rear of dead man's drink (-9, -22) | Changing to happy little trees has removed this glitch | Clipping |
| WL-464 | Horses do not have manes. Remeber seeing them on a stream but missing for me! | the default horse mesh was hidden for some reason. Unhid Requiem’s instance, appears to be working | Clipping |
| WL-460 | Grass clipping through one of the bedrolls in the camp just outside Riverwood | Removed Grass and rocks from affected tent | Clipping |
| WL-1286 | Dwarven breakdown recipes giving more weight of fragments than original item | Added breakdowns for Dwarven Cutlery and corrected existing recipes so that fragments are based on 5 fragments per kilo. | Crafting |
| WL-1265 | Various recipes adding hoods to helmets result in too much crafting XP, and many of the helmeted hoods are missing breakdown/separation recipes | Tagged all the "hooded helmet" items with No Crafting Experience, and added breakdown recipes for any hooded helmets still missing them. | Crafting |
| WL-1262 | Missing breakdown recipes for divine replica amulets | Added missing breakdown recipes for the nine divine replica amulets | Crafting |
| WL-1244 | Mammoth tusk breakdown | Added NoCraftingExperience to all Ingredients crafted by Wildlander, and changed nordic amulet/necklace recipes to use a small animal bone instead of bonemeal | Crafting |
| WL-1219 | MCM Suggestions | Set Requiem and Skald’s Mail so that smithing books are non mandatory, and the courier will still deliver important letters. I also nerfed Hunterborn’s Bounty bonus by 75% | Crafting |
| WL-1188 | Missing Breakdown recipes. | Added breakdown recipes for Cloaks and fur hoods. | Crafting |
| WL-1173 | Crafting lockpicks (need just first Smithing and first Lockpicking perks) grants a LOT of exp for virtually zero gold investment; iron frags are cheap! Probably needs reworking. | Added smelter next to the crafting area at the rear of Birna’s oddments. | Crafting |
| WL-1153 | Breakdown menu has two recipes to craft “disabled” weapons | Moved Tree | Crafting |
| WL-1134 | Track abilility in game is disabled, so why does Bone Amulet of the Full Moon crafting recipe still exist | Disabled Trees | Crafting |
| WL-1104 | Missing recipe - Lantern oil A1247D91 | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Crafting |
| WL-1103 | Starting as a nightblade - no tooltip for other toolkits shown in forge | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Crafting |
| WL-1097 | Healing Poultice Recipe incorrect (item 8141d2CD) | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Crafting |
| WL-1091 | Steel buckle - crafting recipe exists, but nothing can be made with them! | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Crafting |
| WL-977 | Remove non-smithing/metal recipes from Forge to assuage user confusion, add NoCraftingExperience keywords to all pertinent items | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | Crafting |
| WL-929 | Easy smithing Levels exploits | Ebony Smithing requirement to Ebony Mail conversion recipes | Crafting |
| WL-919 | moreHUD carry weight does not update properly when bathing; reequipping a backpack, for example, will not update the total carry weight until player enters magic menu or receives an item | Ebony Smithing requirement to Ebony Mail conversion recipes | Crafting |
| WL-876 | Raven Rock blacksmith cannot craft or temper morrowind gear(bonemold, chitin) | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Crafting |
| WL-766 | Can't meet some crafting requirements, like "Forge" while using a forge. Another I have seen is "Soul Gem: Grand" even though I have one in my inventory. | Removed dummies from offending recipes | Crafting |
| WL-764 | Calcinium Fragments cannot be turned into Calcinium Ingots. | Added missing ingot recipes for both Calcinium and Galatite Fragments. | Crafting |
| WL-727 | Crafting gear at the forge grants no smithing experience; tried with several different types of leather equipment, and reloaded older saves. Smithing is level 4 and I have the first perk (but have since sold the book). | Unable to Replicate. Tried crafting the entire standard Leather Set at Alvor’s forge, plus some random leather items like the doublet. | Crafting |
| WL-662 | Unable to craft Blacksmith's Hammer (spell research tool). I have the first perk in smithing, which I assume would be enough considering that I can craft tongs with that perk. But I cannot see a way to produce a hammer. | Hammer recipe required an Iron Kettle for some reason. Condition has been removed | Crafting |
| WL-653 | Cannot take Orcish smithing with just Dwarven as prerequisite | Added changed Orcish Smithing perk conditions so that the player can have either Morrowind or Dwarven smithing | Crafting |
| WL-643 | Crossbows cannot be ordered via Honed Metal They require Hide Lace, which a smith can craft, but Hide Lace requires Fur Plate, which they cannot craft. | Added Hide Lace to common materials, and patched Honed Metal tanning rack to use our tanning rack keyword (for pelt processing). | Crafting |
| WL-630 | Unable to breakdown linen cloaks into linen for bandages. All? Linen recipe missing from crafting menu. | this is actually an issue with Campfire’s travel cloaks getting added to vendors when they should not be. Patched the campfire vendor quest to replace them with wolfskin cloaks. | Crafting |
| WL-589 | Able to craft "Steel Furred Plate Cuirass" with only the basic crafting perk, not the "Advanced Blacksmithing" perk at smithing 50 that allows the crafting of plate armors. | Fixed Recipe | Crafting |
| WL-573 | Crafting Medicinal Salve at a Forge (only tested in Dawnstar) contributes to leveling Smithing. | added NoCraftingExperience keywords | Crafting |
| WL-557 | empty bottles from craft menu and attempted to refill them at multiple sources. Waterskins refilled normally, but not the "Glass Bottle (Empty)" items. | Added bottle refill script to all varieties of empty bottle, should allow them to refill | Crafting |
| WL-540 | Missing honed metal receipe - Balimund smith in Riften (and maybe more smiths) can't craft Fur Plates (more notes inside) | Fixes to crafting have corrected this issue. | Crafting |
| WL-1175 | Random CTD in solitude SkyrimSE.exe+9C2DCF | Added smelter next to the crafting area at the rear of Birna’s oddments. | CTD |
| WL-1101 | Using f10 to start as a vampire in Karthwasden trigger a crash on spawn SkyrimSE.exe+7BEC84 | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | CTD |
| WL-953 | CTD when trying to interact with Adrianne Avenicci Honed Metal dialogue additions. | Removed Tree from House | CTD |
| WL-866 | I equipped a paper lantern than replaced it with an iron lantern and threw the paper lantern on the floor. SkyrimSE.exe+AA07E4 | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | CTD |
| WL-794 | After crossing a certain threshold in Chillwind Depths, I crash to desktop; it is 100% reproducible on my saves. (SkyrimSE.exe+1309A40) | This is apparently a common repeatable crash, fixed by tarlazo’s Chillwind Depths CTD Fix. | CTD |
| WL-758 | Performing melee stealth kill triggers a killmove camera and game crashes (KERNELBASE.dll+34F69) | Switched to use Violens to stop these Killcams. | CTD |
| WL-749 | A crash to desktop occurring at random loading screens. | I am hoping that the various memory fixes implemented by the linked ticket will help this issue as well, and thus, I am moving this ticket to Testing. | CTD |
| WL-726 | Happens at random as far as I can tell, I've had a few crashes when loading a save. The crashlog I've linked was a save during combat but it has happened before without being in combat. 0x20AAC641F30 | See linked issue 763 for potential solution. This report has a different error code, which is somewhat concerning. Notably, this issue also contains a reference to frostfall projectiles, without a proper crash callstack code; see linked issue 516 | CTD |
| WL-722 | On Save | Coffin crash :) | CTD |
| WL-694 | I have crashed three times, once entering whiterun through the gate, once trying to order something from the blacksmith in riverwood, once going into the general trader in riverwood. | The commonality in all of these seems to be “hkpRigidBody”, which may be a skeleton related issue. However, an unfortunate problem in diagnosing these is that any crash could theoretically be related to the script memory/memory issues. | CTD |
| WL-677 | CTD When entering the Inn in Dawnstar to talk to Stig Salt-Plank during the second phase of the Rise in the East Quest, | Irlof appearance replacer (Beards of Power) shipped with a broken appearance, causing this crash for Irlof. I have updated the mod to the latest version, which fixes the crash. | CTD |
| WL-645 | crash to desktop whenever i try to save. | Coffin Crash :) | CTD |
| WL-639 | After character creation i choose Background: Archer, Birthsign: The Lady, Starting location: Surviving the Wilds, Falkreath, Difficulty: Standard, press Begin Story and Then the sky changes to the moon and in freezes right there. | Unable to Replicate. This may be related to the FISS loading issue (see linked). May be solved with the additional padding and/or memory changes. | CTD |
| WL-602 | Reloading a crossbow in combat is causing a crash; seems related to NECR firing at that time? | Edited the NECR script to initialize on game start. Could not reproduce crash after that. | CTD |
| WL-596 | Buy iron knife from Riverwood Trader, head outside riverwood, equip knife, game crashes | I had no trouble equipping and using the knife, so it’s not a mesh crash. Maybe an animation crash relating to TDM with specific circumstances? | CTD |
| WL-580 | User reporting the infamous Istar Cairn-Breaker crash at 6am in Dragon Bridge (SkyrimSE.exe+21FFE3) |  * Issue 1: Edited the existing Trade Routes script (TRSD_Base) to make the Outer Markup 1.20 and Inner Markup to 1.20. * Issue 2: Edited the Trade Routes script (TRSD_Base) to make Trade Supply 100 instead of 1000. * Issue 3: Edited TRSD_Base to remove Extra Gold, edited all REQ_VendorChest Containers to utilize fewer/default Vendor Gold Leveled List counts * Issue 4: Adjusted Honed Metal’s variables via a quest override within the Wildlander plugin. | CTD |
| WL-570 | CTD: possibly related to Adrianne Avenicci | I have not been able to replicate this issue, but I am hoping it is related to either the CCOR crafting categories (which have been disabled), or oddness with the old version of Honed Metal (which has been updated). Moving to testing. | CTD |
| WL-545 | Wildlander will launch but consistently crashed to desktep during the "finilizing" phase. | Added some Utility.Wait()'s to the FISS loading operations in the Wildlander startup script. There are still FISS operations in Hunterborn and MoreHUD that this would not account for, but this padding will hopefully be enough to prevent the issue. | CTD |
| WL-1266 | "Combination" horse armor recipes result in an overabundance of crafting XP | Tagged all the "adorned" horse armors with No Crafting Experience | Exploit |
| WL-1261 | Recipes for fully assembled jewelry (for example, Gold Amber Circlet) are providing tons of experience because of their value | Tagged the fully assembled items with NoCraftingExperience. Crafting experience will instead come from creating the base materials (gems and base items). Ideally you'd have experience from setting the gems as well, but this is a limitation of basing XP gain on value. | Exploit |
| WL-1184 | Crafting a Stack of items grants the same XP as crafting a single item | XP script corrected to multiply the XP by number crafted. | Exploit |
| WL-895 | Boss loot chests in need of a buff / more interesting loot | Buffed all boss chests with loot pertinent to the enemy type | Exploit |
| WL-887 | It looks like spending too much time (15 + min) in Racemenu at character creation starts an infinite load time. | Fixed as part of 1.1's NPC updates | Exploit |
| WL-886 | Crafting any type of arrows or bolts gives insane amount of experience. | Fixed as part of 1.1's NPC updates | Exploit |
| WL-844 | Adding and removing amulet from backpack leads to infinite experience | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Exploit |
| WL-736 | When using the forge in breezehome, no experience is given for creating anything | Crafting experience is given - but switching workstations fast means the UI doesn't update. Will need update to CCOR to Fix. | Exploit |
| WL-611 | backpacks + god amulets. craft, breakdown and repeat for infinite XP. This should probably be on player crafting. | Disabled Recipes. | Exploit |
| WL-1285 | Immersive Patrols NPC's might not be using proper head parts for High Poly Head | Swapped regular head parts for high poly head versions. | Gameplay |
| WL-1283 | Drink/Refill hotkey does not work | Added a bit of code to SunHelm's startup to force initialize some missing settings. The hotkey now works as designed | Gameplay |
| WL-1282 | Immersive Speechcraft guard dialogue is broken, only displays "Nevermind" | Fixed conditions in combat speech subtopics, works properly now | Gameplay |
| WL-1274 | Double hotkey - FLP and Predator vision | Moved Nightvision and Heat (Predator) vision to respectively | Gameplay |
| WL-1267 | Mjoll the lioness - Not my follower - but i can ask her to carry gear | Fixed improper condition ordering on a Mjoll-specific trade dialogue (60020) | Gameplay |
| WL-1255 | Edit Immersive Speechcraft options and menu to be more immersive | Edited all Immersive Speechcraft options to more closely resemble the modals from The Sims, e.g. they are descriptive actions instead of spoken lines. | Gameplay |
| WL-1132 | Borgakh the Steel Heart - Cannot recruit even with 100 speech as a none orc. | Disabled Trees | Gameplay |
| WL-1095 | Give hunters more powerful combat perks | Added Jenassa-equivalent combat perks to all Hunter npc’s and templates. | Gameplay |
| WL-1036 | Malyn Varyn (Azura's Star warlock) is too far away upon entering the cell, creating a scenario where the player becomes dialogue locked while enemies are attacking | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Gameplay |
| WL-1032 | Immersive Speech/Dialogue affects children | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Gameplay |
| WL-1030 | Innkeepers keep repeating their "greeting" dialogue; doubly annoying when re-entering the cell from a bath, or card game | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Gameplay |
| WL-939 | After loading my most recent saves I am able to play the game but after engaging in dialogue or about 3 minutes in, SkyrimSE.exe+10B9F52 | Ebony Smithing requirement to Ebony Mail conversion recipes | Gameplay |
| WL-836 | You can use pep talk ("Greetings (Speechcraft)" option) dialogue options on Dawnguard dogs | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Gameplay |
| WL-834 | Beast Of Intangible, Ability to Change Race??? | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Gameplay |
| WL-819 | Follower dialogue that should not be visible is visible at one of Markarth Stables' dog companions | There were some leftover dialogue options applying to non-human actors. I removed an erroneous inventory dialogue option, and also routed the non-human “tactics” dialogue to the ordinary options (while excluding things that didn’t make sense, like outfits and teaching spells). | Gameplay |
| WL-666 | Training with HA and 2H gives full level ups. Video provides evidence of HA. | Not an issue. This is how training is supposed to work; I was surprised it didn’t work this way back on LE. oopsie | Gameplay |
| WL-628 | FollowerLivePackage has follower worship, enabling them to do certain actions depending on their deity. Sheogorath followers can spawn cheese out of nowhere and throw it, and that _sometimes_ breaks their AI in combat | Disabled follower worship in the FLP preset we load on game start. | Gameplay |
| WL-581 | Dialogue adjustments: remove black bars, put the notifications back in the proper place, and see if head tracking cannot be re-established (will require fixing card games) | Re-added Improved Camera and head lock for Alternate Conversation Camera. Fixed card game issue by utilizing the camera reset function built into the card game scripts. | Gameplay |
| WL-562 | I was in the Falkreath Inn and looked down at the central hearth and pressed the crafting hotkey and froze for a few seconds before crashing to desktop. | I have not been able to replicate this issue, but I am hoping it is related to either the CCOR crafting categories (which have been disabled), or oddness with the old version of Honed Metal (which has been updated). Moving to testing. | Gameplay |
| WL-560 | Shadow Stone daily power notified me that it was ready, but it is still greyed out and unusable. | I removed SkySA AIO’s power cooldown feature | Gameplay |
| WL-1166 | Riding in 1st person - Jumped off a cliff, My horse despawned on death. | Removed deleteonunload keyword from horse clone records. | Horse |
| WL-835 | Dead horse inventories cannot be looted without turning on manual loot option | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Horse |
| WL-715 | I saw a horse that was left around Falkreath with noone around, so I stole it and used it to get to Whiterun stables. There I tried to use "adopt" to claim the horse but the game CTDs every time I finish naming it SkyrimSE.exe+67D040 | I went and adopted what I believe is the same horse as this user - the Fjord horse floating around Falkreath after the civil war battle. After riding away, I was able to adopt the horse with no issue. | Horse |
| WL-621 | My horse's saddle disappeared (no longer showing on the horse model). I can equip on myself! which cases CTD | was able to replicate the saddle crash, but only once; every other time resulted in the saddle being unequipped automatically, and no crash. Otherwise, all of the saddles and barding behaved normally. | Horse |
| WL-1277 | Animal death item lists are still accessible when animals turn to dust post-Raise Dead | Removed all items from all DeathItem animal and monster leveled lists referenced by Hunterborn. | Items |
| WL-1264 | Steel Furred Cuirass and Steel Furred Plate Cuirass utilize Craftsmanship instead of Advanced Blacksmithing | Edited Steel Furred Cuirass and Steel Furred Plate Cuirass to utilize Advanced Blacksmithing, and edited their recipes for parity with other similar items | Items |
| WL-1246 | Quest Waking nightmare - when on step release the miasma  - And your pretending yto be casimir - you can see your player's body in front of camera (video attached) | Added NoCraftingExperience to all Ingredients crafted by Wildlander, and changed nordic amulet/necklace recipes to use a small animal bone instead of bonemeal | Items |
| WL-1213 | Further crafting fixes | Added Breakdown recipes for Backpacks, Daedric armor, Dawnguard armor and several horse Saddles which were missing one | Items |
| WL-1176 | Armor_LinenMonkBootsBlack_Breakdown Not working | Corrected erroneous Archmage boots entries in the conditions to be able to break down this item. | Items |
| WL-1076 | Armor material keywords need reverting to vanilla for Item Degradation's ini to process correctly. | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Items |
| WL-1051 | Blacksmiths will not improve Nordic Armor | Caused by the Nightvision - no shaders bug. Launcher update for 1.1 will fix this | Items |
| WL-924 | Linen Monk Boots - Black (swapped) do not seem to be giving the swapped version | Ebony Smithing requirement to Ebony Mail conversion recipes | Items |
| WL-880 | Missive to deliver weapon to prisoner in Cidhna Mine | Fixed as part of 1.1's NPC updates | Items |
| WL-873 | CTD on saving, be it manual or quick, after getting the necromancers amulet and leaving the windhelm area. I can sometimes save once or twice after the amulet, usually thou CTD immediately. 0X0, 0x143CAC20360 and SkyrimSE.exe+128C07 | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Items |
| WL-815 | Lord Harkon turns invisible while transformed into a vampire lord | As provided by ImUrGreg. The “SkinNaked” armor added by EasyNPC did not contain the requisite Vampire Lord and Werewolf armor addons, causing these transformations to appear invisible. The armor addons have been added to the record in Wildlander.esp. | Items |
| WL-750 | Kuvar is a master Heavy Armor trainer after taking back Thirsk Mead Hall, but shows as One Handed at the price of 0 Gold and does not function. | For some reason, Fozar’s turned Kuvar into a one-handed trainer; since his dialogue and other elements still reference him being a heavy armor trainer, I edited his class back to master heavy armor trainer. | Items |
| WL-744 | Steel cuirass is stronger than Pauldroned Steel Cuirass. (for armour and warmth while it's also lighter / clearly meant to be less armour | The user was likely referring to the White variant of Steel Pauldroned Cuirass, which had less armor than its standard counterpart. Brought all Steel Pauldroned Cuirass variants in line - they are all slightly better than Steel Cuirass, and also warm | Items |
| WL-738 | Camera stuck on horse instead of character after using grime covered item while mounted. | Added a mounted condition check if !PlayerRef.IsOnMount() to the hunterborn grime scavenging script. | Items |
| WL-732 | Whenever I take a bath (always with soap now) and my character puts her gear back on, she loses all, if not most, of the enchantment buffs from her associated gear. | This one is interesting; tested by bathing, both using soap and not using soap. The enchantments do seem to reappear, but I noticed moreHUD does not update properly until the player re-enters their magic menu, or receives an item. | Items |
| WL-667 | When selling an item that is worth more gold than the merchant has available the item will leave my inventory but I receive no gold. | Reduced vendor's starting gold to prevent overflow. | Items |
| WL-655 | Item: Iron Knife (MISC) is not showing in the inventory when picked up...it is still adding weight to the Weight Limit... and can only be remove via Console command removeitem | I copied all references of the misc knives and forks to override, then replaced them with the weapon versions. From brief ingame testing, this does not appear to cause clipping/havok issues. | Items |

| WL-549 | Holding/Conjuring a weapon to left hand and attempting to Attack with left click does not work. | Installed Dual Wield Block, should be fixed | Items |
| WL-500 | During the companions quest where Farkas transforms he was invisible as a werewolf, and Aela was invisible too when receiving the blood. The PC was not invisible and Skiors dead werewolf body was not invisible. | As provided by ImUrGreg. The “SkinNaked” armor added by EasyNPC did not contain the requisite Vampire Lord and Werewolf armor addons, causing these transformations to appear invisible. The armor addons have been added to the record in Wildlander.esp. | Items |
| WL-1271 | Corporeal Dragons doesn't appear to be working correctly | Hunterborn had a built-in method of preventing the mod from starting during startup, as well as some other tricky checks.

| WL-845 | Riften boatman doesn't register you having the right amount of gold | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Misc |
| WL-842 | GIST and Requium Interaction - Soul Tomatoes do not act like Soul Gems | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Misc |
| WL-831 | Some npcs have not had their facegen converted to High Poly Head. This mostly applies to npcs from the Bijin Mods. Some male npcs don't have high poly beards. | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Misc |
| WL-828 | Gold has too much weight if there is no system for converting gold weight/denominations | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Misc |

| WL-812 | Door to exit Heartwood Mill misplaced | Landscape and Water Fixes adjusted the location, which was being overwritten by Requiem. Forwarded proper location | Misc |
| WL-796 | Whenever you cast spells and then press "x" to hide GUI, The calender at the bottom left, which spells you have equip, and the temperature bar at the right does not get hidden. | This is an odd one for sure - hopefully it will be fixed anyway, with the updated version of the Hide UI code. | Misc |
| WL-783 | Mixing Salmon Roe with any other ingredient that gives Waterbreathing will produce a Waterbreathing Potion that has insane value. | Nerfed the value of Salmon Roe by disabling Auto-Calc, and reducing the ingredient value to 5. | Misc |

| WL-702 | Handwriting font is too difficult for users to read | Reverted Handwriting font to vanilla’s. | Misc |
| WL-688 | Hunterborn (and maybe other mods) does not start. Had to load the FISS Profile, before that couldn't find Huntingknifes at stores and abilities like forage were not available. | This is actually the conflation of two separate issues. The “hunting knives not appearing at stores” is sort of legitimate, in the sense that Hunterborn’s scripts do not seem to apply the knives the way they’re supposed to unless you deactivate / reactivate the option. However, I have already solved this by manually adding Hunting Knives to general goods merchants. | Misc |
| WL-672 | Disable CCOR category menus for compatibility with Honed Metal | Solution: Disabled CCOR category menus for compatibility with Honed Metal, by adding the following to Autorun.txt: set CCO_OptionCraftingMenuOptions to 0 set CCO_OptionCraftingMenuCategories to 0 | Misc |

| WL-663 | I'm playing as a khajiit on a fresh save. I got frostbite on my hands, which was supposed to reduce my skills, but instead increases them. | I decided to disable the frostbite system within Frostfall by editing the _frost_exposuresystem.psc script. The default freezing stats are plenty impactful imo, and this might be a bit less confusing anyway, since players no longer have to understand that Freezing and Frostbite are separate mechanics. | Misc |
| WL-658 | The default economy values seem to be a bit off, fBarterMin and fBarterMax values are much lower than default Vanilla Skyrim and Requiem.  (more in description) | Not an Issue. As far as I know, these are the intended values and they are intended to be set within Trade Routes as the user noted. | Misc |

| WL-575 | Blacksmiths do not have hide lace, and seemingly do not make leather from pelts either. Generally ensure they can make all basic materials | Added Hide Lace to common materials, and patched Honed Metal tanning rack to use our tanning rack keyword (for pelt processing). | Misc |
| WL-554 | Muiri at the Silverblood Inn is missing hair textures | Dunno why EasyNPC fails to grab the proper hair for Bijin Muiri, but no biggie - it was kind of weird anyway. Just rerouted her to be Markarth Side Refine instead | Misc |
| WL-551 | Cannot disable the sneak eye even if hide UI using the x key | Luca has updated his mod to use this new framework, so the old version has been replaced. See linked issue | Misc |

| WL-1215 | Beitild "Beitild" cannot be killed for dark brotherhood quest | Added No flee keyword to this NPC (and to ebony warrior) | NPC |
| WL-1195 | Solitude Outlaw Refuge chef was not selling any food items (despite buying them) | For whatever reason, having his buy/sell list set to VendorItemsInnkeeper was not populating his inventory (maybe because he didn’t belong to the innkeeper faction?) In any case, selecting a different vendor list allowing food seems to have done the job | NPC |
| WL-1168 | Turning the lantern on, then storing it in a chest doesn't turn it off, nor will it let you turn it off with the L key | Added suggested mod NPC's Use Potions | NPC |

| WL-850 | NPC bard "Karita" in the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar has something wrong with her model/clothing. Her nipple can be seen with her default outfit. | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses.

| WL-773 | Summon werebear (duration etc) has not been reqtified at all | I made the unreferenced variant 300 seconds, just in case. | NPC |
| WL-751 | Varin at the copper cask inn in deep water crossing has a fucked up chin and only has trade/rent options. no full meal, water refill etc... | This is actually two issues. One, Varin did not properly belong to the innkeeper faction and therefore missed certain services (fixed by adding to innkeeper faction). Second, his beard and other face parts were not patched for High Poly Head (fixed by patching them for high poly head). | NPC |
| WL-734 | Unable to activate Inconsequential NPCs (Cannot talk to them) | I gave all the Incon NPC’s their own names, which should prevent Real Names from running on them in the first place. | NPC |
| WL-686 | Told companions to All Wait in the Sleeping GIant Inn and they begin to attack the NPCs. My companions are a Stray Dog and Bjalfi Snow-Song. | “Bjalfi Snow-Song” is not an actual NPC, so he is probably one of the Inconsequential NPC mercenaries renamed by Real Names. Unfortunately, this means I can’t know which NPC caused the issue. I did recruit the Stray Dog and issue the “All Wait” command with him in the Sleeping Giant Inn, but no one attacked him. | NPC |
| WL-568 | Weird pathing of NPC´s in Whiterun. Looks like there is a little party behind the house. | Adjusted navmesh to exclude this area; hopefully NPC’s stop using it | NPC |

| WL-329 | Solitude outlaw refuge vendor had no inventory. Also name was different in console. | For whatever reason, having his buy/sell list set to VendorItemsInnkeeper was not populating his inventory (maybe because he didn’t belong to the innkeeper faction?) In any case, selecting a different vendor list allowing food seems to have done the job | NPC |

My 2 handed skill level is 27. | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear.

| WL-740 | After getting Hamal (Dibella priestess in Markarth) to enchant something to me, told me my enchanting level hit 91, which I assume is her enchanting level, and gave me experience to my xp bar. Currently my level of enchanting is 7 when that happened. | Unable to Replicate - this was likely fixed by the update(s) to Honed Metal, as there is a reference to this fix in its changelog. | Perk |
| WL-718 | Cost of enchanted items drops drastically after putting in first perk into enchantment tree. | I did not fix the pricing, but rather prevented players from being able to use enchanting tables in the first place by adding a perk WL_EnchantingBlocker to the player on startup that blocks activation of any furniture with keyword WICraftingEnchanting | Perk |

Afterwards when I visited again the Imperial guards supposed to be there are now walking around wearing no armor and only loincloths. | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | Quest |
| WL-821 | "Gather 10 bear pelts for Temba Wide-Arms in Ivarstead" doesn't recognize non-vanilla quality pelts. | Added a custom script WL_PeltSwapper to all Fine and Flawless pelts, allows you to downgrade these pelts into standard quality for the purpose of turning them in for quests. | Quest |

| WL-705 | Companions quest rewards are too low | edited CompanionsHousekeepingScript to differentiate the gold rewards based on companions quest difficulty (roughly). I say “roughly” because some quests can still send you to either a bandit camp/animal den, OR a vampire/warlock den.

| WL-553 | ESF Companions - Cannot progress - user done 12 radiant quests but next stage isn't starting | Since at this point we’re only using ESF Companions to edit the required amount of radiant quests, I’ve replaced ESF with  More Radiant Quests for the Companions, which simply edits the amount of radiant quests needed for each stage. (I have edited the requirements to 10 for Trial, 5 for Circle, and 5 for Kodlak.) | Quest |
| WL-539 | Valdr not accepting Potion of Restore Health (crafted) | Removed the Requirement to have started dragonborn from the Morrowind smithing recipes | Quest |
| WL-524 | In my quest journal i have oen quest 'A requim for better times'. description is 'requim is installing'. | Adjusted startup script to complete the quest. | Quest |
| WL-427 | Unable to start the Thieves Guild quest line. | Updated to V5 of Thieves guild requirements which resolves this issue. | Quest |
| WL-1280 | Spell selection is erroneously displaying when users create a custom class | Edited the manual skill selection script to bypass the spell selection state entirely, and jump straight to the final state | Spell |

| WL-1131 | Enchant Lvl 100 does work, but only at 55% instead of 75% magnitude | Disabled Trees | Spell |
| WL-997 | Absorb Essence and possibly other spells don't have archetypes for spell research | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | Spell |
| WL-878 | I just came across "Return to Severin Manor" spell, and to be honest, that's just broken for Requiem | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Spell |
| WL-791 | Spell Research is going to need further patches, as it imports, for example, the Invisibility spell as an Expert spell (vanilla rank), while it is an apprentice spell in Requiem, this makes it give waay too much experience. | Patches have been checked and edited where nessisary to ensure that the spells give correct levels of experience | Spell |
| WL-786 | Bloodskal Blade not working properly, the one that do woosh and send an red magic damage arc fly. Does not work, it seem that damage is there, but .. no distant attack woosh. | Unable to Replicate. Seems to work for me | Spell |
| WL-769 | "Restoration Ritual Spell" quest destription says that I "have been granted the Bane of the Undead" spell, which is not the correct name | Corrected the quest stage copy to read “Repel Undead (Rank III)” instead of “Bane of the Undead”. | Spell |
| WL-743 | The experience gained from studying invisibility seems to be broken. A few study session yield 438,943 novice experience. | Updated Plot’s spell research requiem patch, should fix this | Spell |
| WL-730 | Casting any spell with restricted use area (conjuration spells, runes, etc.) while sneaking causes the crosshair to disappear. Fix included | The fixed version actually does not seem to affect anything, as the issue itself does not appear - perhaps due to SmoothCam getting updated? Interestingly, the crosshair does sort of “flicker” as though it’s trying to disappear while sneaking/casting runes, but it never actually disappears. | Spell |
| WL-678 | Add more paper to general goods merchant stocks, also wizards | Turns out that for some reason, Spell Research does not give every wizard the wizard merchant list. I gave it to every wizard, which means far more paper and other wizard stuff | Spell |
| WL-616 | Temple of Dibella : Infinite Health, Magicka and Stamina | I disabled the activators for this spell within the Dawnstar Dibella bathhouse. The player should no longer receive this bonus when utilizing the facilities. | Spell |
| WL-1259 | Ultrawide resolution support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors | Added full support for 21:9 and 32:9 monitors. All HUD elements have been adjusted and rescaled, scripts updated, and launcher updated. Thanks to user LeapDay for their help, plus the Wildlander team. | UI |
| WL-1204 | Adding a new item to favourites isn't removing from the breakdown menu when using a keyboard + controller (and using the F key) | Script for breakdown menu was only refreshing favorites when using the key from controller. This has been corrected, | UI |
| WL-992 | Left Casting/ Weapon swingind NOT working while standing | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear.

This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | UI |

| WL-971 | Thalmors believe Dragon Bridge is the Ultimate Rebel Village or something | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | UI |
| WL-966 | The X hud button is cancelled out by too many actions | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | UI |
| WL-954 | In Honed Metal, if your select the option to have NPCs have rare materials, when you try any of the HM menu options, the menu closes, and the PC is frozen in place. | Removed Tree from House | UI |
| WL-855 | I can wear two sets of gloves, normal elven (honed by Eorlund and enchanted) and thalmor elven (just enchanted, Eorlund cannot see them in the list and hone). They are both in slot 33 (checked in the inventory). | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | UI |
| WL-765 | Start as a wood elf, use the command animal ability, it'll be greyed out forever from that point. I haven't tested to see if it does this in other regions or on other animals. Sabre cats were all I used it on. | This is only half-solved, really. I have removed the SkyUI AIO Survival feature that causes the string script issue (though that is fundamentally caused by the incompatibility between SkyUILib and SkyHUD). However, there is still an issue with Cooldowns not respecting time elapse from mods like Train and Study. | UI |
| WL-728 | Widgets appear over inventory menu when buying/selling or looting inventory. | Added the fixed version of SkyHUD, per Uranreactor. | UI |
| WL-644 | In the Crafting Menu (Right Shift) I searched a recipe, typed 'b' and it caused the follower framework window to pop-up | prevented hoykeys firing when using filters. | UI |
| WL-641 | Barrels and Chests act like minecraft enderchests.  did purchase 2 barrels and one chest and all 3 share the same inventory. | Not an Issue because this is technically how those mods are intended to function. Needs replacing with a new container-specific framework. | UI |
| WL-577 | Tempering tiers, durability, HUD display are unintuitive and need revising | set iEquip MCM settings to no longer fade from bottom to top, giving the appearance of weapons being nearly broken when their tempering tier is degrading | UI |
| WL-556 | So there's a confusingly large list of additional items in my forge menu, outside of the Complete Crafting menu options. (jester armor and commoner's clothes.) | Addition of crafting tools greatly reduces this list | UI |
| WL-555 | In the Crafting Menu (Right Shift) I searched a recipe, typed 'b' and it caused the follower framework window to pop-up. I have not tested if other hotkeys producing command prompts are still enabled in the crafting menu, but they should be. | Dylan Demonstrated this had been fixed on stream | UI |
| WL-469 | the first two Sunhelm perks in the Campfire menu increase your carry weight by 50 each, and they're really easy to get. | Adjusted Perks to 15/30. | UI |
| WL-359 | 3 new menus have placeholder names | Manually changed the name via an override for the config quests. The MCM’s themselves still display strings, but I don’t care nearly enough to fix that whole mess | UI |

| WL-973 | No Light version of the Stormcloak Cuirass appears to exist in game. | I have removed the “Use Inventory” flag from each of the 3 ETaC Dawnstar Imperial guards, and given them gear from leveled list CWSoldierImperialGear. This will bypass the need to grab gear from that script, and if that was the issue, they should have gear now." | Visual |
| WL-863 | When performing research (eg 3 hours) on visibility, an insane amount of experience is received on illusion and light. | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Visual |
| WL-859 | Ancestor Glade extremely bright and saturated | I have removed all crates from the vanilla player houses. This issue is caused by Dynamic Things making the crates lootable (and therefore respawning). | Visual |

| WL-721 | Elsi's journal isn't there? | The Wildlander.esp was assigning a different model for the book that might’ve been from an older version of Book Covers Skyrim. I think this model assignment was rendering the book invisible. | Visual |
| WL-534 | Missing hair texture from #177 in RaceMenu, specifically KS Hairdos (0Dawn) | My guess is that foregoing the EasyNPC generation has “fixed” this | Visual |
| WL-436 | The Necromancer's Amulet is invisible when worn. | Reverted Necromacers amulet to use Requiems Texture - as CCOR's is missing a mesh | Visual |
