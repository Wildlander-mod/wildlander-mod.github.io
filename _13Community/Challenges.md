## The Serf Start

**Difficulty:** Extreme  
**Focus:** Medieval immersion, early-game hardship

Is your Wildlander experience too easy? Make your early game an even more miserable experience, the medieval way.

The goal of this challenge is to begin your Wildlander character as truly helpless as possible, emulating the life of a peasant farmer in the dark ages. This will make the early game incredibly difficult, and force the player to rely on non-combat methods of increasing their skills, like training and studying.

We recommend using a F10 - Custom start to do this, as it will mean less stuff to remove.

**Installation Steps:**

1. Remove all background related skills and perks.
    - Remove all perks. You can either choose to do a F10 "custom start" and select from the MCM to start with 0 perks. Or, if using the standard Wildlander start, then use the command `SPP 0`
    - Lower your background related skills by using the command `player.setav (skill id) 1`. You may optionally keep your race related skill bonuses (e.g., if you pick the Nord race, keep the skill bonuses from your race). Do not lower your skills to zero as this will cause issues with scripted leveling such as quests, skill books and dummies.

2. Remove all background related starting gear from your inventory.
    - For most characters, this will include a weapon, some armor, and some miscellaneous gear, like a toolkit.
    - You may keep any gear which a peasant would reasonably have, like a torch.

3. Drop all your gold.

Congratulations! You are now ready to experience the world of Skyrim as its people would - like a true medieval peasant.

**Optional Difficulty Modifiers:**

1. Lower skill gain in the Requiem MCM menu (recommended: 50%)
2. Do not commit any crimes - The Divines frown upon unseemly deeds
3. Only save at the start of each day, after waking up

{: .note}
> This challenge was intended to be played alongside DamnPeasants's own challenge to create a truly miserable experience. Being the dragonborn is optional, but for true serfdom, pick non-dragonborn.

**Decision Making & Behavior:**

- Cannot loot anything guards killed (includes animals straying into towns or vampires from missives). If you didn't kill it yourself with no assistance, you can't loot it.
- Cannot loot enemy armor from corpses with value/weight ratio less than 50, unless enchanted (prevents breaking down trash for smithing leveling). Looting from containers is allowed.

  - Raw materials
  - Food/Water

- If a summoner with the "Cognitive flexibility" perk, cannot have any followers
- Maximum one follower (exception: dragon hunting - can bring larger party as afforded)
- Can only save at dungeon entrances and before/after walking through doors with loading screens (recommend disabling autosaves)

**Optional:**

- Restoration is powerful and easy to level - consider restricting the "Power of life" perk or "Essence of life" perk
- Orc not allowed - they're overpowered
