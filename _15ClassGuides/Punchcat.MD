## Description

Unarmed build with Light Armor instead. Speedy Cat clawing down people left and right. Alteration is picked for Transmute Muscles. Illusion for Shadow Shield attack speed later. Don't expect to be fighting dragon priests or enchanted sphere's with this build - you don't have the capability of stopping their health regen long enough to burst them down.
