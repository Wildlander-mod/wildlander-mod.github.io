## Description

A typical Warrior build with Heavy Armor, no-magic. Can go with any type of two-handed weapon. Goal is to finish Companions Questline so here is a typical version with Nord, wielding battleaxes as befits Companions. Crossbows used for ranged damage. 

The build is going to be wearing Pristine Wolf Armor + Wuuthrad for the looks. At late game when Enchanting/Smithing is at 100, we switch to enchanted dragonbone weapons&armor.
