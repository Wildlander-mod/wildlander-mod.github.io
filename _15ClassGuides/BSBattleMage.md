## Description

A Heavy Armor, Battlestaff build. Daedric battlemage armor and daedric battlestaff aimed for not only the most badass looks, but also for really powerful destruction power with spell power armor traits. Nord/Atronach combo is chosen as it’s one of the best ways to make battlemage build. Then we utilize Illusion to buff AR a bit since daedric battlemage armor only has 700 AR. Later on Shadow Shield for one of the fastest sprinting PA’s and Shadow Simulacrum to tank stuff for you are great additions. Lastly, we go Enchanting and Smithing to craft/temper our powerful Daedric gear.
