# Deep Dive: Nether's Follower Framework

Nether's Follower Framework (NFF) is a comprehensive follower management system that replaces Skyrim's vanilla companion mechanics with advanced features for recruiting, managing, and interacting with followers in more dynamic and flexible ways.

---

## What is Nether's Follower Framework?

NFF overhauls Skyrim's follower system to provide:

- **Advanced Follower Recruitment** - Hire followers from NPCs without vanilla follower restrictions
- **Flexible Management** - Manage multiple followers with improved AI and behavior controls
- **Customization Options** - Configure follower appearance, equipment, and combat behavior
- **Advanced Interactions** - More dialogue options and relationship mechanics with followers
- **Performance Optimization** - Better follower AI that doesn't tank frame rates

### How NFF Differs from Vanilla

**Vanilla Skyrim followers:**
- One official follower per faction (usually)
- Limited recruitment options
- Followers always reset to default equipment
- Basic AI with limited customization
- Performance issues with multiple followers

**NFF followers:**
- Any NPC can potentially become a follower
- Multiple followers can be managed simultaneously with proper configuration
- Equipment management respects your choices
- Advanced AI packages with granular control
- Optimized code for better performance

## Core Features Explained

### Recruiting Followers

NFF allows you to recruit followers by:

   - Completing a quest related to them
   - Reaching certain skill levels
   - Having specific items or gold
   - Completing a task for them first

3. **Managing your follower count** - NFF respects a follower limit based on your settings
   - Dismiss followers temporarily if you want to recruit someone new
   - Followers wait at designated locations (default: nearest tavern)

### Managing Multiple Followers

With NFF's advanced system:

- **Follower Groups** - Organize followers into squads for tactical advantage
- **Stance Control** - Command followers to be aggressive, defensive, or passive
- **Position Control** - Order followers to guard locations or wait in specific spots

## Using NFF in Wildlander

### Wildlander-Specific Considerations

**Follower Needs Integration:**
- Followers subject to hunger, thirst, and fatigue like the player
- Must camp and rest with the group
- Require food and water supplies during expeditions
- Be aware of stamina drain affecting follower performance

**Combat Mechanics:**
- Requiem de-leveling means follower level matters significantly
- Properly equipped and leveled followers are essential for dangerous content
- Equipment tempering directly affects follower effectiveness
- Follower crafting skills can support your progression

**Economy Impact:**
- Hiring multiple followers increases your gold requirements
- Follower equipment costs impact your budget
- Consider training followers to offset recruitment costs

### Practical Workflow

**Early Game:**
1. Recruit one strong follower (Lydia or similar high-value recruit)
2. Equip them with your old gear as you upgrade
3. Manage needs together - camp and eat together
4. Use follower as pack mule for carrying supplies

**Mid Game:**
1. Recruit specialized followers for different playstyles
2. Use groups for difficult encounters
3. Assign followers to player homes between expeditions
4. Manage equipment across multiple followers

**Late Game:**
1. Build optimal follower teams for specific dungeon types
2. Maintain equipment quality through tempering
3. Use followers strategically for boss fights
4. Consider marriage/romance for preferred followers

## Advanced Techniques

### Follower Squad Composition

**For Melee-Heavy Dungeons:**
- Heavily armored tank follower (heavy armor, shield)
- 1-2 damage dealers (different weapon types)
- Optional healer/support

**For Magic-Heavy Content:**
- Follower with spell reflect or magic resistance
- Ranged damage dealer (bow or spells)
- One versatile follower

**For Stealth Playstyle:**
- Followers that stay undetected (sneak-capable followers)
- Backup damage if detection occurs
- Lockpicking specialist if available

### Performance Optimization

If experiencing frame rate issues with multiple followers:

1. Reduce follower count in MCM
2. Disable unnecessary follower mods that conflict with NFF
3. Lower follower render distance
4. Use follower groups instead of large parties
5. Consider follower mods that optimize AI (like "Smart AI Tweaks")

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Followers not leveling with player:**
- Check NFF MCM - ensure follower leveling is enabled
- Verify follower isn't set to "Level 1 locked" mode
- Re-recruit the follower if issue persists

**Equipment resets when loading game:**
- Enable "Equipment Management" in MCM
- Ensure follower armor rating isn't higher than they can equip
- Use NFF's equipment interface instead of direct inventory management

**Followers dying constantly:**
- Lower combat aggressiveness setting
- Improve their equipment (higher armor rating, better weapons)
- Consider their skill level relative to dungeon difficulty
- Use stance control to make them more passive

**Frame rate drops with multiple followers:**
- Reduce follower count
- Disable unnecessary visual follower mods
- Lower shadow quality for distant followers in graphics settings

## Common Questions

**Can I have unlimited followers?**
NFF respects a hard limit based on performance. Wildlander typically supports 3-6 active followers depending on your PC. Use dismissal and recall features to rotate followers between active duty.

**Do followers need to be fed and rested?**
Yes, with Wildlander's survival needs mods integrated. Followers require sleep, food, and water. Plan expeditions around these needs by camping together.

**Can followers use the crafting system?**
Followers don't directly craft, but their skill levels affect their equipment effectiveness. A high-smithing follower can handle better equipment quality, but they don't independently improve items.

**How do I remove NFF if needed?**
Remove the mod and dismiss all followers before uninstalling. Save the game after dismissals. NFF scripts should then clean up.

## Next Steps
