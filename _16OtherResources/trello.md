## Before You Suggest

{: .important}
> **Search first!** Check both the [**Roadmap**](#roadmap) and [**Current Mods**](https://airtable.com/shrYZ76EgAF8wLxuj/tblPeqg1bIAnUaFb4) to see if your mod has already been suggested or included. Duplicate suggestions will be declined.

## Suggest a Mod

To suggest a mod for consideration, **[fill out this form](https://airtable.com/shrcKWMTGlJJON2tP)**.

Your suggestion will be reviewed and assigned a status (see [Status Definitions](#status-definitions) below).

{: .hint}
> Suggesting a mod does **not** guarantee inclusion. Approved mods do not have a guaranteed timeline—they're added when they best fit the roadmap.

### Exclusions (Auto-Declined)

Suggestions matching these criteria will be automatically declined:

- **Skyrim Together Reborn** - Not compatible. (Please stop suggesting this!)
- **Specific Authors**: Mods by Elsopa, Wizkid's, or Arthmoors (deliberately excluded from Wildlander)
- **AI Voicelines**: Mods using OpenAI, ChatGPT, or other 3rd-party AI tools
- **NSFW Content**: Sexmods and nude skins (Wildlander is SFW only)

### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Likelihood |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Approved** | Good fit for Wildlander from initial assessment. Will likely be integrated. | 75%+ |
| **Considering** | Needs in-game testing to assess fit and compatibility. | 50%+ |
| **Unlikely** | Poor quality (textures/voice), high performance cost, or doesn't fit the list philosophy. May be used as framework only. | 25%+ |
| **Declined** | Superseded by other mods, causes issues, or has major integration flaws. Will not be included. | 0% |

{: .important}
> **Important**: Even "Approved" mods are not guaranteed inclusion if underlying integration issues arise during development. No timescales are provided—approved mods are added when they best fit the roadmap.
