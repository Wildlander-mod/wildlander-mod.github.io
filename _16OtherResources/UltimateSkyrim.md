## Before we begin
	
There are a few things you’ll need before we begin. Please ensure that you have:
	
1. At least 40gb of free space.
1. An archive tool, such as <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-Zip</a> or <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/download.html?L=0" target="_blank">WinRAR</a>.
1. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank">The latest version of Microsoft’s Visual C++.</a> (You’ll need both the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GD6QJeu.png" target="_blank">32-bit</a> _and_ the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/P76cONh" target="_blank">64-bit</a> versions.)
1. <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework" target="_blank">The latest version of the .NET Framework Runtime.</a>
1. No _Skyrim_ mod subscriptions on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/72850/workshop/" target="_blank" class="swi">Steam Workshop</a>
1. A clean, **ENGLISH** version of _Skyrim_ installed through Steam, <a href="https://i.imgur.com/nFkzKu7.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. (Non-English versions unfortunately crash the game.)
1. The **GamePass** version of _Skyrim_ is unfortunately not compatible at this time.

We also highly recommend a <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?%2Fstore%2Fcategory%2F1-premium-membership%2F">Nexus Premium membership</a> for automating the download process. This feature is controlled by _NexusMods_ - _Ultimate Skyrim_ is not affiliated.

Once that’s squared away, we can begin!

## Step ONE: running the game

The first task is to run _Skyrim_ through Steam, which will prepare your install for _Ultimate Skyrim_.<ol data-rte-list="default">
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/XI0wjdr" target="_blank">Launch “_The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_”</a> from your Steam library.
1. When the launcher offers to auto-detect your settings, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ztPt9zn" target="_blank">click “OK”</a> and then <a href="https://imgur.com/a/2RCmEXT" target="_blank">dismiss the follow-up window.</a> (These settings do not matter, and will be replaced.)
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/T5euYTf" target="_blank">Click “Play” to launch the game.</a>
1. Once the main menu has loaded, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/zZw5bLA">select “Quit” to return to desktop.</a>

Running the game generates files that Ultimate Skyrim needs to function. Now it's time to download & install!

---

## Step TWO: download & installation
Next, we’ll download &amp; install _Ultimate Skyrim_ using the _Wabbajack_ modlist installer**. <br>** If you encounter any issues with the _Wabbajack_ install, please visit the <a href="https://discord.gg/wabbajack" target="_blank">_Wabbajack_ Discord server</a> (channel: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/YBW5xDx" title="" target="_blank">“ultimate-skyrim-support”</a>).
	
1. <a href="https://mega.nz/file/HZl2WIhD#5WmvkefR-ZKv0NqrxbgpRWfZcbM9AikOXAZYAf1Ac9g" target="_blank">Click this link to download the install package.</a>
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/WAuTDVD" target="_blank">Open the download</a> and then <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jefvfES" target="_blank">place the “UltSky” folder</a> in the location you’d like for your _Ultimate Skyrim_ install.<br> <br><font style="color: #ea9999;"><strong >Warning:</strong> </font>There are some restrictions on install location. <strong>‍</strong>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> place the folder in:<strong><br></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Program Files or Program Files (x86), or their subfolders;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Users folder, or its subfolders;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Steam folder, or its subfolders;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the <em>Skyrim </em>folder, or its subfolders;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Desktop folder, or its subfolders;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• the Documents folder, or its subfolders;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• any folders with <a href="https://imgur.com/oWhAxYm" target="_blank" class="link-49">non-English</a> characters;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• any cloud storage folders (e.g. Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.).<br><br>
1. Download Manually the Wabbajack File <a href="https://build.wabbajack.org/authored_files/direct_link/Ultimate%20Skyrim.wabbajack_4b99a0c2-7207-44d7-998d-6dadaa890591" target="_blank">from here</a>
1. Within your “UltSky” folder, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/lVobEVh" target="_blank">navigate to the “installer” folder</a> and then <a href="https://imgur.com/a/U44EBtK" target="_blank">double-click “Wabbajack.exe”</a> to run _Wabbajack_.
1. When _Wabbajack_ opens, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ktMlAJU">click “Install From Disk” NOT browse modlists - as this list is no longer available on wabbajack itself</a> and then Locate the Wabbajack file you downloaded earlier
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JIaD03w" target="_blank">Click this box to select the installation location</a>,**** and then <a href="https://imgur.com/a/d4wrAjl" target="_blank">select your “content” folder</a> from within the “UltSky” folder.<br>**WARNING: Make sure to select your “content” folder, and NOT the “Skyrim” folder containing TESV.exe. The latter will break your install!** 
1. **(Optional)** If you have a pre-existing Ultimate Skyrim installation, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/CrcglnP" target="_blank">click this box &amp; manually select your old Downloads folder</a> to utilize any pre-existing downloads. (If this is a new Ultimate Skyrim install, you can skip this step.)
1. We’ll now begin the _Wabbajack_ installation. <a href="https://imgur.com/qT91atW" target="_blank">Click this button to begin the install</a>, and if you’re asked to accept the Nexus API, click “Accept”.
1. **(Optional)** If you are not a Nexus Premium member, <a href="https://streamable.com/5uuzo" target="_blank">this gif</a> will guide you through the manual install. (If you’re a Premium member, you can skip this step.)
1. When installation completes, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/3ynKuVf" target="_blank">click “Install Folder” to open up the install.</a>
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/pUXhAKL" target="_blank">Open “Game Folder Files”</a>, and then <a href="https://imgur.com/a/1OVC0tv" target="_blank">copy all files within the folder.</a>
1. Navigate to your root “Skyrim” folder &amp; <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rkFkLHw" target="_blank">paste the files you copied.</a>
1. One of the files you pasted is called “enblocal.ini”. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Uoxw2Tl" target="_blank">Open the file</a>, and then <a href="https://imgur.com/yfBDnJI" target="_blank">configure it according to this guide.</a>

Next up, we'll move through the "Known Issues" guide to fix some remaining bugs with the current build.

## STEP THREE: known issues

There are some small issues with the current build that you can fix with the “Known Issues” guide.<ol data-rte-list="default">
1. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10jxUuBhmnLne5e4lb7ifAz9rByrTy_wEOpojmItyScM/preview" target="_blank">Click here for the “Known Issues” guide.</a>
1. Look through the guide. If you desire, follow its instructions to make changes.

## STEP FOUR: in-game configuration

Congratulations - _Ultimate Skyrim_ is now successfully installed! Next we'll configure the in-game settings, and then you'll be ready to play.

Before you can play, _Ultimate Skyrim_ requires the configuration of several in-game settings. We’ll configure these now.

1. Navigate to your “content” folder, and <a href="https://imgur.com/a/sqJnfEl" target="_blank">double-click “Launch Ultimate Skyrim.bat”.</a><br>(Note: If this does not launch your game, refer back to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10jxUuBhmnLne5e4lb7ifAz9rByrTy_wEOpojmItyScM/preview" target="_blank">Known Issues guide</a> for a fix.)
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MrjOhXI" target="_blank">Select a performance profile</a> within the launcher.
1. **(Optional)**  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/mwRo6x4" target="_blank">Click “Create Desktop Shortcut”</a> to generate a <a href="https://imgur.com/6fDCp1U" target="_blank">desktop shortcut</a> for the preset you selected. (This will also create a shortcut for the launcher.)
1. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/k6DuaT1" target="_blank">Click “Launch Ultimate Skyrim”</a> to start the game.
1.  From _Skyrim’_s main menu, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/HlJpQMu" target="_blank">start a new game.</a> (Note: _Ultimate Skyrim_ requires a new game, and is **not** compatible with old saves.)
1. At this point, you will see many messages appear in the corner, indicating the initialization of mods and features. **Please wait until all of these messages have cleared, and you see** <a href="https://imgur.com/a/BUSG0UF" target="_blank">**a blank screen like this.** </a>
1. When the screen has cleared, press Esc/Start to open the game menu &amp; <a href="https://imgur.com/a/b7Vx0tA" target="_blank">select “Mod Configuration”.</a>
1. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1atILnDe7x-FKG0Oahvpq-dAe_PEgIEcSFj1Li2Kia0g/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click this link for the Mod Configuration guide,</a> and adjust your settings accordingly.<br>(Note: It’s highly recommended to open this guide in a second monitor or on your phone for easy side-by-side reference.)
