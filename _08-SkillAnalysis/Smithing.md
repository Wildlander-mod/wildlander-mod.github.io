## Improving Items 

* Improving items require associated Smithing perks and materials.
* You can start improving items starting from 15 Smithing skill level.
* Unlike vanilla, you can improve general enchanted items without Arcane Blacksmithing perk.

## Fortify Smithing

* Requiem prevents Vanilla Alchemy + Enchanting stacking by disallowing Fortify Enchanting and Smithing potions from being crafted by player. They can only be found rarely and randomly in some locations.
* Spell Research does allow Elixer based Smithing potions by combining Metal, Flesh and Mortals Alchemy solutions.
* You can still enchant items with Fortify Smithing, or find pre-enchanted items with Fortify Smithing.
