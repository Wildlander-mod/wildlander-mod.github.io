## Customizing Your Keybindings

Most keybindings can be reconfigured to suit your preferences:

**For mod-specific hotkeys (Campfire, FLP, Predator Vision, Sunhelm, etc.):**
- Open the **MCM Menu** in-game (Escape → Mod Configuration)
- Find the relevant mod (Campfire, FLP, Predator Vision, Sunhelm, iEquip, etc.)
- Look for the "Keybindings" section and rebind as desired

{: .warning}
> **FLP MCM Note:** Only configure the Toggle Formation keybinding in the FLP MCM. The mod is not well-maintained, so avoid changing other settings as they do cause issues and conflicts.

**For SkyUI Group Equip hotkeys (F1-F4):**
- Open **SkyUI**'s settings through the MCM menu
- Navigate to the Hotkeys section
- Customize F1-F4 assignments

**For standard Skyrim controls (including Save/Quick Load):**
- Press **Escape** to open the pause menu
- Select **Settings** → **Controls**
- Rebind any standard keyboard/mouse controls
- Note: Some controls may be locked by mods

**Tip:** Press **F11** in-game at any time to see a quick reference of your current keybindings!
