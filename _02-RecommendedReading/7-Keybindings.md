## What Do these Keys do?

### Lock On

This is for 3rd person gameplay and keeps you facing the target you have locked onto when you are moving or strafing around. It also helps with arrow aiming.

### Quick Restore

A keybind to restore your health stamina or magic using preset rules (set in Iequip) from potions within your inventory.

### Breakdown

Shows a crafting menu to deconstruct items in your inventory into component parts.

Note: This key won't let you deconstruct any "found" enchanted items.

### Emergency Recall

Lost your followers? This is the key you want.

### Survival vision.

A useful utility. It allows you to see amongst other things. Herbs which can be picked, dropped weapons or arrows, Enemy movements (e.g Bandit using loud equipment, growling animals) Items which can be used to craft Tinder (such as linen wraps) and Dead Bodies.
