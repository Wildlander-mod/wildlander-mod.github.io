## Main UI

## Frostfall Temperature Gauges

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26418143/156928451-23af3960-f610-4a7d-b93f-d0ad6f63dd3f.png)


The **Center bar** represents your current exposure. As your exposure increases, the meter will fill up. The more full it is, the more penalties you suffer. Once it is full, you die. The glow around the center bar indicates you are currently warm from standing near a fire.

The **white line** is the maximum exposure indicator. This is the highest your exposure will increase to in that area. If the indicator is all the way on the other side of the meter, that means that the area has lethal (maximum) exposure. If your exposure is currently higher than the indicator, your exposure will decrease to meet it as you warm up.

The **thin bar** at the top indicates how warm your surroundings are.

The **thin blue bar at the bottom** is the wetness meter. As you get wetter, it will increase. As you dry off, it will decrease. Being wet increases the rate your center bar fills up.


## Sunhelm needs icons

Next to Frostfall indicators are 3 icons which appear “more solid” the more Hungry/Tired/Thirsty you are.




## iEquip Current equipment and enchantment charge status 

Right side – Contains the Currently Equipped main-hand weapon, Its tempering (Exquisite) its durability (fades from White, to red when low durability) and the charge – The Circle around the icon.

## SkyUI 

SkyUI is a complete overhaul of the clumsy and more console-friendly user interface while keeping true to the style of the original UI. It makes the user interface much easier to use with mouse and keyboard, being less wasteful of screen space and is, aesthetically speaking, far more pleasing. 


### Inventory Screen

The inventory screen has a lot more additional columns which can be turned on or off using this icon.
