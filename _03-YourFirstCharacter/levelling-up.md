## Why Leveling is Different Here

Wildlander uses **Requiem's de-leveled world system**. This means:

- **The world is not scaled to your level.** NPCs, creatures, and equipment have fixed difficulty levels
- **You must be appropriately leveled for specific areas.** A Level 5 character cannot survive Bleak Falls Barrow the same way a Level 50 could
- **Early training is essential.** Combat training, perks, and properly tempered gear matter far more than raw level
- **You should train deliberately** before attempting dungeons, using safe methods and progression paths outlined below

**TL;DR:** If you rush into high-level areas unprepared, you will die repeatedly. Spend your first 5-10 levels training systematically in safe zones.

## How Skills Level Up

Each skill has a **leveling multiplier**—skills with higher multipliers (like Lockpicking at 45) level much faster than skills with lower multipliers (like Destruction at 1.35). Understanding this helps you focus training efficiently.

### Combat Skills

| Skill | Multiplier | How to Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sneak | 11.25 | 2.5 XP for becoming hidden (~45 ft). 0.625 XP/second hidden. 30 XP for melee sneak attack. 2.5 XP for ranged sneak attack. |
| Archery (Marksman) | 9.3 | Base Weapon Damage of the Bow |
| Pickpocket | 8.1 | 1 base XP per gold value stolen. |
| Block | 8.1 | 1 base XP per raw damage blocked. 5 XP for a shield bash. |
| One-Handed | 6.3 | Base Weapon Damage |
| Two-Handed | 5.95 | Base Weapon Damage |
| Heavy Armor | 3.8 | 1 base XP per raw damage received. Additional XP for moving while wearing armor. |
| Evasion Armor | 4 | 1 base XP per raw damage received. Additional XP for moving while wearing armor. |

**Key Insight:** Sneak, Archery, and Pickpocket level fastest. Block and weapon skills level slower but are essential combat basics.

### Crafting & Survival Skills

| Skill | Multiplier | How to Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enchanting | 900 | 1 base XP per item enchanted. 0.05-0.6 XP for recharging weapons. |
| Lockpicking | 45 | 0.25 XP for a broken pick. 2-13 XP for successfully picking a lock. |
| Speech | 0.36 | 1 base XP per gold used in transactions. 75 * Speech level for passing Speech checks. |
| Alchemy | 0.75 | 1 base XP per gold value created. 1 XP for each successfully created potion. |
| Smithing | 1 | See [Crafting System - XP Gain](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_10-Crafting/1.1-Crafting-System/). Smithing XP has diminishing returns: first craft = 3x base XP, second craft = 2x. Always craft items at least twice. |
| Foraging | Variable | Higher levels let you specify what to forage. |
| Butchering | Variable | Processing dead animals levels this skill. |
| Endurance | Variable | Run around in cold areas to passively level. |
| Survival | Variable | When any of your needs reach maximum value, Survival skill increases. |
| Camping | Variable | Building campfires and tents levels this. Skills menu allows faster building in harsh weather. Max campfire = 6-hour 5% XP gain buff. |

**Key Insight:** Enchanting and Lockpicking have massive multipliers—they level extremely fast. Smithing is essential but has diminishing returns, so craft at least twice per item.

### Magic Schools

| Skill | Multiplier | How to Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Destruction | 1.35 | Base Magicka Cost of the Spell. Base XP = Damage inflicted. |
| Restoration | 2 | Base XP = damage healed by healing spells. 1 XP per Magicka used on non-healing spells. Base XP for Sun spells on Undead. |
| Conjuration | 2.1 | Base Magicka Cost of the Spell. ⚠️ **Slowest magic school to level**—keep a summons active at all times and cast Summon Swarm ranks 1 or 2 against safer enemies such as Horkers or skeevers to accelerate leveling. | 
| Alteration | 3 | Base Magicka Cost of the Spell. |
| Illusion | 4.6 | How long you can warp the target's mind vs how resistant the target is to your magic. |

**Key Insight:** Magic skills level slowly. Illusion has the fastest magic leveling (4.6 multiplier) and has passive levelling by keeping upkeep spells active, but still slower than physical combat. Use active training methods (below) to accelerate magic skill growth.

## Active Training Methods

### Combat Training

**Training Dummies (Safest Method)**
- Available in all cities
- **How to use:** Equip your weapon or spell, then activate (press E) the dummy to begin training
- No damage taken, no need for supplies
- **Works for:** Weapon skills (One-Handed, Two-Handed, Archery). For magic, **only Destruction benefits** from dummy training (casting damage). Other magic schools level better through Spell Research Journal.
- **Recovery:** After training, find a bed to sleep away fatigue (1 hour study = 2 hours sleep needed)
- **Recommendation:** Use these first to level Weapon skills to level 10-15 before risking real combat

**Combat Progression Path (After Training Dummies)**

1. **Whiterun Sewers (Levels 1-5)** - Safe starter area
   - First few rooms: Level 1-2 Mudcrabs, Skeevers only
   - ⚠️ WARNING: Deeper rooms have dangerous enemies. Don't venture too far.

2. **Wildlife (Levels 5-10)**
   - Mudcrabs around Whiterun (careful: Level 10+ Sabercats/Bears also in area)
   - Prey animals, Wolves, basic enemies
   - Equip a Crossbow as soon as possible—they trivialize many wildlife encounters

3. **Bandit Camps (Open World, Levels 10-15)**
   - Less dangerous than dungeons
   - Good gold and equipment loot
   - Avoid caster bandits until higher level

4. **Starter Dungeons (Levels 15-20)**
   - Helgen (bandits)
   - Embershard Mine (bandits)
   - Halted Stream Camp (bandits)
   - **DO NOT attempt Bleak Falls Barrow without:** Silver weapons (tempered), perks in both armor and weapon skills, and Level 50+ in both skills

### Spell Research

**What it is:** The Spell Research Journal allows you to safely level magic skills without entering combat. It's essential for Mages, Conjurers, and anyone training Restoration, Conjuration, Alteration, or Illusion.

**Where to find it:** Available from the College of Winterhold or crafted once you have the Spell Research mod.

**How to use:**
1. **Equip a spell** in one or both hands
2. **Activate the Spell Research Journal** from your inventory
3. **Select "Research"** to enter research mode (wait for initialization)
4. **Choose your training method:**
   - **Cast the spell repeatedly** to level through active casting (uses Magicka)
   - **Study passively** using the journal for slower but more sustainable XP gain (no Magicka cost)
5. **Exit research mode** by activating the journal again
6. **Sleep to remove fatigue** (1 hour of study = 2 hours of sleep needed)

**Best for:** Restoration (2.0), Conjuration (2.1—especially with Summon Swarms in safe areas), Alteration (3.0), and Illusion (4.6) magic schools. **Destruction is better trained on training dummies.**

**Pro tip:** Study spell research during downtime—while traveling, between combat encounters, or right before sleeping. This passive training adds up quickly without using Magicka resources.

### Camping

Every campfire you build and tent you pitch will level Camping skill. The skills menu (accessible when using a campfire) allows you to:
- Build fires quicker in harsh environments
- Allocate perks from the Camping and Sunhelm mods
- Reach maximum campfire for 6-hour 5% XP gain buff

**Tip:** Build a campfire first thing in the morning and every time the buff expires for consistent XP boost.

### Crafting

- **Smithing:** Craft items from low-cost materials with high sell prices. First craft = 3x XP, second craft = 2x. **Always craft at least twice per item.** See [Crafting Toolkits](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_10-Crafting/Crafting-Toolkits/) for more details on efficient smithing setups.
- **Alchemy:** Mix potions to gain XP per potion created and per gold value of potions made. Use a portable **mortar and pestle** to craft alchemy recipes anywhere. Spell Research cauldrons and alembics also grant XP by dissolving ingredients.
- **Enchanting:** Every item enchanted grants XP. Use a portable **enchanting kit** to enchant items in the wild. Cauldrons are used for dissolving **Imbued or Enchanted loot** to extract essences.

### Foraging & Gathering

**Foraging Skill:** Levels by using the forage mechanic. Higher levels let you specify what to forage.

**Butchering Skill:** Process dead animals after hunting/combat to level this skill.

**Endurance Skill:** Run around in cold areas to passively level Endurance.

**Survival Skill:** Levels whenever any of your needs reach maximum value (Hunger, Thirst, Cold, Fatigue, or Uncleanliness).

## Safe Training Without Combat

### Skill Books

- Available throughout the world
- Study books in your inventory for extended periods
- Grants training for however long you study
- Effective for any skill with a book available

### Spell Research Journal

See Spell Research section above under Active Training Methods. The Spell Research Journal is the primary method for training most magic skills without combat risk and can be studied during downtime to accumulate XP passively.

### Training Dummies (Revisited)

See Combat Training section above. Training dummies are your safest, most reliable way to level weapon and magic skills without risk. **Note:** Block must be leveled through actual combat (blocking damage).

## Your First Progression Path

### Levels 1-5: Learn & Prepare

**Goals:** Survive basic encounters, get baseline perks, gather starter equipment

1. **Use training dummies** to reach Weapon Skill Level 15
2. **Loot battlefields** (Imperial/Stormcloak skirmishes) for starter gear and gold
3. **Visit Whiterun Sewers** first two rooms only—mudcrabs and skeevers only
4. **Craft and temper gear** with looted materials (aim for iron or steel weapons/armor)
5. **Farm Smithing** by crafting simple items twice each
6. **Pick up easy Missive Board quests:** Mudcrab parts, wolf pelts, skeevers—these are quick kills

### Levels 5-10: Safe Combat Training

**Goals:** Build weapon/armor perks, level combat skills, gather better gear

1. **Continue training dummies** (weapon skills to 25-30)
2. **Hunt wildlife** around Whiterun (avoid bears, sabercats—they're Level 10+)
3. **Mudcrab hunting** is safest
4. **Equip a Crossbow** as soon as possible (preferably one that doesn't break—Dawnguard is good)
5. **Attack Open World Bandit Camps** once you have weapon level 30+ and armor level 20+
6. **Complete easy Missive quests** for reliable XP and gold
7. **Aim to reach Level 10** before attempting any dungeons

### Levels 10+: Ready for Dungeons

**Goals:** Tackle starter dungeons, build comprehensive perks, prepare for mid-game

1. **Pick easier dungeons:** Helgen, Embershard Mine, Halted Stream Camp (bandit camps, not draugr)
2. **Never enter Bleak Falls Barrow** without:
   - Silver weapons (tempered)
   - Armor skill Level 50+
   - Weapon skill Level 50+
3. **Continue farming Smithing** to keep gear tempered
4. **Take on more Missive quests** as difficulty increases
5. **Join factions** for additional training and perks (Companions, Dark Brotherhood, and others offer good early options)

**Faction Notes:** The College of Winterhold requires 25+ skill in any magic school before joining. The Thieves Guild has additional quest requirements before entry—see the [Thieves Guild requirements](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_04WildlanderWorld/5-The-Quests/) for details. The Companions and Dark Brotherhood have no minimum skill requirements and are accessible early.
