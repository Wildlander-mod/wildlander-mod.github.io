## CRITICAL: Do These First!

{: .warning}
**Avoid combat until you're level 3-5!** Wildlife will kill you at level 1. Play safe and focus on survival and leveling.

**Immediately after character creation:**

1. **Allocate your 6 perk points** - Don't skip this! Assign them to your build
2. **Set up the "Q" Favorites menu** - Assign hotkeys (0-8) for quick weapon/spell switching
3. **Review keybindings** - Press **F11** to see all critical hotkeys
4. **Go to Riverwood** - It's the safest starting location. Run north from Whiterun Inn

## The First Hour: Survival Basics

Your FIRST priority is staying alive. Get these items and skills working:

### 1. Food & Water (first priority to to make sure that we have food and drink to meet needs)

| Need | Action | Hotkey |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Drinking** | Find a river or collect milk from cows to drink | **;** (water) / **E** (milk) |
| **Cooking** | Cook raw meat at a campfire | **Right Shift** |

{: .note}
Establish food and water sources before adventuring—once hunger or thirst icons appear, the negative status effects will accumulate quickly. Having reliable access to both prevents complications during exploration or training.

### 2. Warmth & Sleep (Establish Early)

- **Get a tent** (find a free one, craft one, or buy from a merchant) to sleep in - refunds stamina
- Tents restore sleep need but at 75% effectiveness compared to inn beds
- **Inn beds restore full sleep and grant the "Well Rested" buff** (+10% Magicka Regen for 8 hours)
- **Build a campfire** when traveling to reduce exposure
- Check your **Exposure gauge** (bottom right of screen) - it rises in cold/wet weather

| Warmth Item | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Fur Tent | Protects from cold |
| Leather Tent | Protects from rain |

{: .note}
**Exposure is fatal in harsh weather—build a campfire or find shelter immediately when weather turns bad.** Sleep sources (tent/bed) can be established later when the exhaustion icons appear, but warmth cannot be ignored.

### 3. Cleanliness (IMPORTANT)

- **Bathe in rivers regularly** (Hotkey **'/@**) - BUT avoid rivers in cold climates as they raise exposure
- **Use soap when bathing** - Different soaps provide beneficial buffs (see [Cleanliness](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/03-YourFirstCharacter/Needs/#cleanliness) on the Needs page for soap types and effects)
- **Alternatively, hire a bathroom from innkeepers**  Available everywhere and better than bathing in cold rivers (see [Needs & Survival](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/03-YourFirstCharacter/Needs/#inn-bathrooms) for a full list of bathroom locations)
- Dirtiness reduces your speech skill and disease resistance
- **Always bathe before buying/selling** to get better prices (see [Cleanliness](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/03-YourFirstCharacter/Needs/#cleanliness) for dirt effects)

## Early Game Income (Levels 1-5)

You need gold to buy gear and food. Here are your best options ranked by profit:

### Best: Fishing (Easy + Profitable)

1. Buy a fishing rod from a general merchant, or find a free one at the Guardian Stones (near Riverwood if you start there)
2. Equip it as a weapon and "attack" a water source to fish
3. You can get armor, weapons, unique fishing rings, and the fish itself
4. **Most profitable activity for solo players**

### Good: Foraging & Herbalism

- Use Forage ability (Hotkey **>**) to search for plants
- Pick all herbs you see - they all sell
- Combine with cooking for extra value

### Okay: Wood Chopping

- Get a wood chopping axe and harvest trees (by attacking them) or use Wood chopping blocks at lumber mills
- Sell the wood (1g each - not great but early money)
- Use leftover wood to make kindling and level Camping skill

{: .note}
**Attacking trees with weapons degrades them faster.** Chopping blocks at lumber mills are safer for your gear. If you must chop trees, use a dedicated wood-chopping axe and keep a backup weapon ready.

### Good: Missive Board Quests

- Check missive boards in nearby cities for delivery quests
- Easy way to earn early gold while exploring

### Tip: Always Bathe Before Selling

Dirtiness reduces your speech skill and disease resistance, making merchants harder to negotiate with. Always bathe before visiting merchants to get better prices.

**Best bathing options:**
- **Innkeepers** (12 gold for 12 game hours access, available everywhere) - Safest option and prevents exposure
- **Rivers** (Hotkey **'/@**, free but avoid cold climates due to exposure) - Use soap for beneficial buffs
- See [Cleanliness](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/03-YourFirstCharacter/Needs/#cleanliness) on the Needs page for soap types and effects

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you're **fully clothed** (at least a chest piece) before selling. Nudity has harsh selling penalties. This is especially critical when handing your primary armor to [NPCs for upgrades](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/09-How-Do-i/NPC-Crafting-Services/)—always have backup clothing to wear while they work on your gear.

## Before You Start Adventuring: Shopping List

**Priority (Get These):**
- [ ] Primary weapon (2H, 1H+Shield, Bow, Staff, etc.)
- [ ] Armor/clothing for your build
- [ ] Hunting knife (for harvesting dead animals)
- [ ] 1+ waterskin (for portable water)

**Important (Strongly Recommended):**
- [ ] Backup weapon (for when your primary breaks)
- [ ] Backpack (increase carry weight)
- [ ] Cloak (extra protection)
- [ ] Fishing rod (best early income)
- [ ] Tent (if you plan to camp)

**Optional (Depends on Your Build):**
- [ ] Cooking pot (if camping regularly)
- [ ] Mortar & Pestle (if you're an Alchemist)
- [ ] Research Journal (if using Spell Research - beneficial for Mages, Alchemists, Enchanters, or anyone wanting magic skill XP without perks)
- [ ] Crafting toolkits (if you want to craft immediately)

## Important Notes on Equipment

**Weapons and armor degrade** in combat, so you need backups ready. [Tempering](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/04WildlanderWorld/1-Tempering/) improves weapon damage and armor resistance. **Important**: Wood-based bows can break if hit by melee attacks—carry a backup bow or a melee weapon for close combat situations.

**Armor & Clothing stats**: Cover protects from wet weather, Warmth protects from cold. Pick appropriate gear for where you're traveling.

**Waterskins** let you carry portable water (fill from any river or use hotkey **;**). Better than manually drinking every time.

{: .note}
**In northern regions** (north of Morthal  Horizonal line accross the map), rivers give saltwater instead of freshwater. You'll need a **cookpot** to distill saltwater into drinkable water. If traveling north without a cookpot, carry enough waterskins of fresh water before leaving the south, or ask for refil's at inns.

---

## What to Avoid at First Level

- **Don't fight bandits or animals** - They're too strong at level 1
- **Don't go to dungeons** - Come back at level 5+
- **Don't ignore exposure in harsh weather** - Exposure is fatal and requires immediate action (build a campfire or find shelter)
- **Don't neglect armor** - Even basic gear makes a huge difference
- **Don't travel north without fresh water** - Rivers give saltwater north of Morthal; you'll need a cookpot or pre-filled waterskins

---

## Your First Safe Routine

This is a simple routine to follow until level 3-5:

1. **Start in the South** with your gear and fresh waterskins (avoid northern regions until you have a cookpot)
2. **Spend time fishing** - Most profitable, safe activity
3. **Forage while traveling** - Free money
4. **Cook meals at campfires** - Keep your hunger need managed (bonus: leftover food sells for profit)
5. **Sleep when exhaustion icons appear** - Rest in your tent or find an inn bed
6. **Sell your goods** (always bathe first for better prices!)
7. **Buy new gear** with proceeds
8. **Repeat until level 5**

By level 5, you'll have: better gear, more perks, full supplies, and be ready for light adventure.
