## CRITICAL: Do These First!

{: .warning}
**Avoid combat until you're level 3-5!** Wildlife will kill you at level 1. Play safe and focus on survival and leveling.

**Immediately after character creation:**

1. **Allocate your 6 perk points** - Don't skip this! Assign them to your build
2. **Set up the "Q" Favorites menu** - Assign hotkeys (0-8) for quick weapon/spell switching
3. **Review keybindings** - Press F11 to see all critical hotkeys
4. **Go to Riverwood** - It's the safest starting location. Run north from Whiterun Inn

## The First Hour: Survival Basics

Your FIRST priority is staying alive. Get these items and skills working:

### 1. Food & Water (ESSENTIAL)

| Need | Action | Hotkey |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Drinking** | Find a river and drink | `;` |
| **Cooking** | Cook raw meat at a campfire | `Right Shift` |
| **Milk** | Press E near cows to collect | E |

{: .note}
Dehydration and hunger will kill you faster than enemies. Drink and eat constantly at first.

### 2. Warmth & Sleep (ESSENTIAL)

- **Get a tent** (find a free one, craft one, or buy from a merchant) to sleep in - refunds magicka and stamina
  - {: .note} Tents restore sleep need but don't provide "Well Rested" bonuses. Inn beds give both sleep restoration AND the Well Rested buff (+10% all skills for 8 hours)
- **Build a campfire** when traveling to reduce exposure
- Check your **Exposure gauge** (bottom right of screen) - it rises in cold/wet weather

| Warmth Item | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Fur Tent | Protects from cold |
| Leather Tent | Protects from rain |

### 3. Cleanliness (IMPORTANT)

- **Bathe in rivers regularly** (Hotkey `'/@`)
- Dirtiness reduces your speech skill and disease resistance
- **Always bathe before buying/selling** to get better prices

## Early Game Income (Levels 1-5)

You need gold to buy gear and food. Here are your best options ranked by profit:

### Best: Fishing (Easy + Profitable)

1. Buy a fishing rod from a general merchant, or find a free one at the Guardian Stones (near Riverwood if you start there)
2. Equip it as a weapon and "attack" a water source to fish
3. You can get armor, weapons, unique fishing rings, and the fish itself
4. **Most profitable activity for solo players**

### Good: Foraging & Herbalism

- Use Forage ability (Hotkey `>`) to search for plants
- Pick all herbs you see - they all sell
- Combine with cooking for extra value

### Okay: Wood Chopping

- Get a wood chopping axe and harvest trees at lumber mills
- Sell the wood (1g each - not great but early money)
- Use leftover wood to make kindling and level Camping skill

### Good: Missive Board Quests

- Check missive boards in nearby cities for delivery quests
- Easy way to earn early gold while exploring

### Tip: Always Bathe Before Selling

Dirtiness reduces your speech skill and disease resistance. Always bathe in a river (Hotkey `'/@`) before visiting merchants to get better prices.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure you're **fully clothed** (at least a chest piece) before selling. Nudity has harsh selling penalties. This is especially critical when handing your primary armor to [NPCs for upgrades](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_09-How-Do-i/NPC-Crafting-Services/)—always have backup clothing to wear while they work on your gear.

## Safe Combat Practice

If you want to level combat skills without risking your life, use **Training Dummies** in major cities. These are free, safe, and give you XP for practicing combat. Simply activate them (press `E`) and you can practice combat safely before fighting real enemies.

## Before You Start Adventuring: Shopping List

**Priority (Get These):**
- [ ] Primary weapon (2H, 1H+Shield, Bow, Staff, etc.)
- [ ] Armor/clothing for your build
- [ ] Hunting knife (for harvesting dead animals)
- [ ] 1+ waterskin (for portable water)
- [ ] Iron Lantern (press `L` to toggle; better than torches)

**Important (Strongly Recommended):**
- [ ] Backup weapon (for when your primary breaks)
- [ ] Backpack (increase carry weight)
- [ ] Cloak (extra protection)

## Important Notes on Equipment

**Weapons degrade** in combat, so you need a **backup weapon** ready. Tempering improves damage. **Important**: Wood-based bows can break if hit by melee attacks—carry a backup bow or a melee weapon for close combat situations.

**Armor & Clothing stats**: Cover protects from wet weather, Warmth protects from cold. Pick appropriate gear for where you're traveling.

**Waterskins** let you carry portable water (fill from any river or use hotkey `;`). Better than manually drinking every time.

---

## What to Avoid at First Level

- **Don't fight bandits or animals** - They're too strong
- **Don't go to dungeons** - Come back at level 5+
- **Don't ignore hunger/thirst** - It's your primary threat early on
- **Don't neglect armor** - Even basic gear makes a huge difference
- **Don't forget to sleep** - Sleeping refunds resources and is a safe activity

---

## Your First Safe Routine

This is a simple routine to follow until level 3-5:

1. **Start in Riverwood** with your gear and waterskins
2. **Spend time fishing** - Most profitable, safe activity
3. **Forage while traveling** - Free money
4. **Cook meals** when you have raw ingredients
5. **Sleep in your tent** before heading back to civilization
6. **Sell your goods** (always bathe first!)
7. **Buy new gear** with proceeds
8. **Repeat until level 5**

By level 5, you'll have: better gear, more perks, full supplies, and be ready for light adventure.
