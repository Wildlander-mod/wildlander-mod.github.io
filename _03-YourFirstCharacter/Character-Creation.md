## Questions about is your build viable?

Any build is viable in the early game. It genuinely does not matter, you can run pretty much anything you want.

Build viability only becomes a problem once you reach things with lots of perks, armor or regen in the mid-game.

If you just want to Play around killing bandits or whatever, you can pretty much play anything you want. But if you wanna complete all the content, defeat Alduin, kill Miraak, etc. you're gonna run into trouble, unless you pick a 'Meta' build.

Going a Spellsword/Battlemage build is not recommended for beginners - as there are a lot of mechanics relating to heavy armor & spell casting that make this one of the hardest builds to master.

General rules for successful build - One ranged ability, One Defense ability, One melee ability and 3 support skills.

## Beginner-Friendly Requiem Builds

{: .warning}
**Important:** This is a **Requiem-based modlist**. Vanilla Skyrim playstyles do not apply. Requiem significantly changes combat mechanics, enemy scaling, and build viability. These recommendations are tailored for Requiem's difficulty curve.

### Why Vanilla Builds Don't Work in Requiem

- **Enemies scale with you** - You cannot overlevel content; difficulty stays challenging
- **Damage is more lethal** - Both you and enemies deal significant damage
- **Perks matter more** - You need specific perks to be effective with a weapon type
- **Magic is harder early** - Spell costs are high and enemies have good resistance
- **Armor is essential** - You'll need proper armor for survival

### Recommended Beginner Builds for Requiem

**1. Barbarian (Light Armor + Two-Handed) (Easiest)**
- **Why it works:** High mobility, strong two-handed damage, flexible playstyle
- **Best Race:** Nord or Orc
- **Key Skills:** Two-Handed, Light Armor, Smithing, Evasion
- **Stone:** Warrior or Steed
- **Why for beginners:** Similar to the heavy armor warrior but more mobile, good damage output, easier gear maintenance

**2. One-Handed + Shield Knight**
- **Why it works:** Balanced offense and defense, very survivable
- **Best Race:** Imperial or Nord
- **Key Skills:** One-Handed, Block, Heavy Armor, Restoration
- **Stone:** Lord or Lady
- **Why for beginners:** Block provides damage reduction, easier to kite enemies, Restoration helps with healing

**3. Two-Handed Warrior**
- **Why it works:** Simple playstyle, high damage, straightforward perk progression
- **Best Race:** Nord or Orc
- **Key Skills:** Two-Handed, Heavy Armor, Smithing
- **Stone:** Warrior or Lord
- **Why for beginners:** Doesn't require micromanagement, good survivability, clear progression path

**4. Restoration Cleric**
- **Why it works:** Self-healing, support magic, can hold your own in combat
- **Best Race:** Breton (magic resistance helps) or High Elf (extra magicka)
- **Key Skills:** Restoration, Heavy Armor, One-Handed, Block
- **Stone:** Mage or Apprentice
- **Why for beginners:** Healing keeps you alive, doesn't require aggressive spell slinging. You can cast a healing aura before combat while naked and avoid most of the magic penalties.

### Builds to AVOID as a Beginner

- **Pure Mage** - Magic is expensive early game and enemies resist it heavily. Get used to movement or dodging before picking this.
- **Spellsword/Battlemage** - Requires balancing heavy armor, spellcasting, and melee (very difficult)
- **Stealth Archer** - Requires understanding of sneak mechanics and positioning
- **Hybrid builds with many skills** - Spread too thin, won't be effective

### General Requiem Beginner Tips

- **Focus on 3-4 skills maximum** - Spreading perks thin makes you weak
- **Get armor early** - Unarmored characters die quickly
- **Smithing is your friend** - Upgrade your gear frequently
- **Don't waste perks on utility** - Lockpicking, Pickpocket, etc. aren't essential for combat
- **Stamina management is critical** - Power attacks and blocking drain stamina; manage it carefully
- **Invest in Restoration early** - Healing yourself is better than relying on potions

## Choosing Your Race & Build

**Not sure which race to pick?** Use this quick guide based on your preferred playstyle:

### Melee Combat (Warriors)
**Best Choices:** Nord, Orc, or Redguard
- **Nord** - Strong two-handed damage, frost resistance, best for dual-wielding or 2H weapons
- **Orc** - Highest stamina pool, excellent for heavy armor and damage output
- **Redguard** - Balanced damage and stamina, great for hybrid playstyles

### Ranged Combat (Archers)
**Best Choices:** Wood Elf, Khajiit, or Redguard
- **Wood Elf** - +15 Archery bonus, excellent with light armor
- **Khajiit** - Best movement speed, strong pickpocket/sneak perks for stealth archers
- **Redguard** - Balanced stamina for holding arrows

### Magic (Mages)
**Best Choices:** High Elf, Breton, or Wood Elf
- **High Elf** - Most magicka, best spell efficiency, recommended for pure mages
- **Breton** - Good magic resistance, can absorb enemy spells
- **Wood Elf** - Balanced magicka, works for hybrid magic builds

### Stealth/Thief
**Best Choices:** Khajiit, Wood Elf, or Dark Elf
- **Khajiit** - Highest movement speed, excellent for sneaking and lockpicking
- **Wood Elf** - Good light armor bonus and sneak bonus
- **Dark Elf** - Balanced offense and stealth, fire resistance useful

**Note:** Any race can play any build—these are just the optimized choices. Pick based on lore preference if you want!
