## Understanding Difficulty & De-leveling

Wildlander is a **de-leveled world**: enemies don't scale with your level. This means:

- **Levels 1-5:** Avoid dungeons and bandit camps. Focus on gathering, fishing, and training.
- **Levels 5-15:** You can attempt easier content (bandits, wildlife), but still be cautious.
- **Levels 15+:** You unlock harder content with better perks and gear.
- **No "quest anywhere":** Not all content is available at level 1—some locations have enemies far beyond your current skill.

**Key Takeaway:** If you're dying repeatedly, you're in content above your pay-grade. Come back later with better gear and skills!
