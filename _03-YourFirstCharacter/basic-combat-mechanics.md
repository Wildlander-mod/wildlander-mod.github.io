# Basic Combat Mechanics

Combat in Wildlander is **deadlier and faster** than vanilla Skyrim. Everyone—you, enemies, wildlife—hits harder and dies faster. One wrong move can kill you.

**This is not a game where you can wade in, attack randomly, and win through attrition.** You must plan, scout, position strategically, and understand your enemies' strengths and weaknesses.

The difference between survival and death is **knowledge and tactics**.

---

## The Scout-First Rule

**Scout before you fight. Always.**

Before engaging any enemy:

1. **Look around** - What enemies are present? How many?
2. **Listen** - Use your ears to locate unseen enemies (everything makes noise)
3. **Use Instincts** (default: **Right Alt**) - See enemy levels and equipment from range
4. **Ask yourself:**
   - What are they wearing?
   - What are they wielding?
   - Where is the high ground?
   - Where are the archers?
   - Where are the mages?
   - How will they try to kill me?

**If you don't scout, you will die wondering what happened.**

{: .tip}
**Instincts (Right Alt)** - All three combat approaches (melee, ranged, magic) can use Instincts to identify hidden or distant targets. This reveals their level, equipment, and position—critical for planning your engagement. See [Keybindings](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_02-RecommendedReading/7-Keybindings/) for the full keybind reference.

## Understanding Enemy Strengths

Know what makes each enemy dangerous—and remember that **the same rules apply to you**. If you're a mage, you're a glass cannon. If you wear heavy armor, you're slow. Understanding your own strengths and weaknesses is just as critical as understanding your enemies'.

### Heavy Armor Enemies
- **Strength:** Very tough, hard to kill, resist damage
- **Weakness:** Slow movement, vulnerable during power attacks
- **Counter:** Circle behind them, backstab, dodge their attacks and counter-attack

### Archers
- **Strength:** Deadly at range, can kill you before you reach them
- **Weakness:** Useless in close combat, long reload time (especially crossbows), wooden bows break with a single melee hit, backup weapon is a dagger
- **Counter:** Use cover (rocks, trees, buildings) to get closer—archers will advance toward you if you're in cover. Once they close distance, they're vulnerable to melee. Use Blur spell if available as a mage to reduce damage taken while approaching.

### Mages
- **Strength:** Deadly at range, can kill you quickly with spells from a distance
- **Weakness:** Glass cannons—very low health, die quickly to focused attacks despite moving fast
- **Counter:** Treat mages as **priority targets**. Use spells or crossbow from range to take them out first before they cast devastating spells. Do not let them stay alive in a prolonged fight.

### Two-Handed Weapon Users
- **Strength:** Massive damage, power attacks knock you down
- **Weakness:** Slow attack speed, long recovery time between attacks
- **Counter:** Side-step dodge the attack, counter-attack during their recovery window

### Shield Users
- **Strength:** Block all frontal attacks successfully
- **Weakness:** Can't block from behind
- **Counter:** Circle to their side/behind, use magic or ranged attacks to bypass shield

### Light Armor/Unarmored Bandits
- **Strength:** Fast, mobile, high damage output
- **Weakness:** Low health, die quickly to focused attacks
- **Counter:** Kill quickly with ranged attacks or catch them off-guard

### Wolves (and other pack animals)
- **Strength:** Hunt in numbers, attempt to flank
- **Weakness:** Single wolves always retreat; vulnerable when caught alone
- **Counter:** Focus all attacks on one target; use terrain/cover to prevent flanking

### Mudcrabs
- **Strength:** Power attacks knock you down
- **Weakness:** Hunches up right before power attacking (tells you when to dodge)
- **Counter:** Watch for the hunch animation, dodge the power attack

### Bears
- **Strength:** Massive damage, very tough, equivalent to a two-handed heavy armor wielder
- **Weakness:** Slow movement, vulnerable during and after power attacks
- **Counter:** Dodge their attacks and counter-attack during recovery, circle to avoid charges, do not engage early game

### Sabercats
- **Strength:** Excellent camouflage, ambush predators that will jumpscare you
- **Weakness:** Once engaged, they're fast but fragile compared to bears
- **Counter:** Scout carefully and listen for growls; use ranged attacks when possible; if ambushed, get distance and heal immediately

## Quick Reference: Enemy Weaknesses Table

Use this table to quickly identify how to counter each enemy type:

| Enemy Type | Primary Weakness | Counter Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| **Heavy Armor** | Slow movement; vulnerable after power attacks | Dodge and counter; circle to backstab |
| **Archer** | Useless in close combat; wooden bows break | Use cover to approach; archers will advance on you |
| **Mage** | Glass cannon; low health despite speed | Priority target—use spells/crossbow from range |
| **Two-Handed Wielder** | Long attack animation; slow recovery | Side-step dodge; counter-attack during recovery |
| **Shield User** | Can't block behind | Circle to flank; use magic/ranged to bypass |
| **Light Armor Bandit** | Low health; fragile | Kill quickly with ranged or melee |
| **Wolf Pack** | Single wolves retreat | Focus fire; use terrain for cover |
| **Mudcrab** | Hunches before power attack | Dodge when hunch appears |
| **Bear** | Slow movement; vulnerable after attacks | Dodge recovery window; circle to avoid charges |
| **Sabercat** | Fragile once engaged; ambush only on first hit | Listen for growls; use ranged; get distance if ambushed |

## Combat Priority: Kill Order

Your engagement strategy should always follow this priority:

### Step 1: Deal with Ranged Enemies First
- Archers and mages can kill you from outside melee range
- Locate them first during scouting
- Use cover and positioning to minimize arrow/spell damage
- Kill them before closing on melee enemies

### Step 2: Eliminate Light Armor Enemies
- They're fragile and die quickly
- If you can kill them fast, fewer enemies to deal with overall
- They're mobile and fast, so catch them early or they escape

### Step 3: Engage Heavy Armor Last
- They're tough and take the longest to kill
- Use hit-and-run tactics (attack, retreat, heal, repeat)
- Don't commit to prolonged melee with them until they're weakened

### Step 4: Manage Your Stamina
- Remember: power attacks cost massive stamina and slow you down
- At early levels, avoid power attacks entirely
- Use light attacks and positioning instead
- Block only when necessary (it costs stamina)

## Weight Matters: Mass Effect

Your equipped gear weight significantly impacts combat. This includes **armor, weapons, and clothing**—everything you wear counts toward your total mass.

### Heavy Armor

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower movement speed
- Higher magicka costs to cast spells
- Higher stamina cost for attacks
- Louder (harder to sneak)

**Advantages:**
- Better resistance to stagger and knockback
- Higher chance to stagger/knockback enemies
- High armor rating (physical defense)
- Charge mechanics are more effective

### Evasion (Light Armor)

**Advantages:**
- Faster movement speed
- Lower magicka/stamina costs
- Quieter (easier to sneak)
- More responsive combat

**Disadvantages:**
- Less protection against stagger/knockback
- Lower armor rating
- Takes more hits to survive

### Clothing

Clothing has **no armor rating** but offers unique benefits:

**Advantages:**
- Fastest movement speed
- Lowest spell casting costs
- Quietest (best for sneaking)

**Disadvantages:**
- Zero protection (no armor value)
- Vulnerable to all damage
- Dies fastest in combat

Clothing adds weight to your total mass, so watch your total load—even casual robes add up if you're carrying heavy gear.

**Early Game Strategy:** Evasion armor is usually better than pure clothing for combat. Use clothing for sneaking, social situations, or magic-focused builds where you won't be tanking hits.

## Combat Flow: Beginner Tactics

Here's a simple combat rotation for new players:

### Melee Combat Approach

1. **Scout first** - Use Instincts from range
2. **Position** - Get high ground or use cover to control engagement
3. **Target priority** - Archers → Light armor → Heavy armor
4. **Engage cautiously** - Use light attacks and blocking only; avoid power attacks
5. **Manage stamina** - Don't let it drop too low; retreat to recover
6. **Disengage if overwhelmed** - Fall back, heal, and reassess

### Ranged Combat Approach

1. **Scout hidden** - Use Instincts to identify targets before being spotted (use sneak if you have perked into it)
2. **Find cover** - Position behind rocks/trees to avoid melee
3. **Snipe priority targets** - Archers and mages first
4. **Keep mobile** - Don't stay in one spot; move frequently
5. **Fallback plan** - If melee reach you, switch to backup weapon or retreat

### Magic Combat Approach

1. **Keep distance** - Mages die fast in close combat (use sneak if you have perked into it for positioning advantage; use invisibility + sneak if you have Illusion perks)
2. **Manage magicka** - Watch magicka pool; spell costs multiply if low
3. **Use weaknesses** - Fire on frost enemies, shock on water enemies, etc.
4. **Utility spells** - Bound weapons, Mage Armor, damage buffs when available
5. **Escape route** - Always have a fallback (invisibility, teleport, or flee)

## Advanced Tactics

### High Ground Advantage

- **Position yourself above enemies** - On rocks, hills, or structures
- **Enemies must path to you**, which takes time and leaves them vulnerable
- Use this time to attack from range or cast spells
- Perfect for archers, mages, and ranged characters

![It's over, I have the high ground](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExdjdhNXoxYnNuenhpZzNqMXpuMWhwZ3VzYTl6OGZpenZsbjc3MnFldCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/7JsEgDMrziuJd9fFY1/giphy.gif)

### Kiting (Baiting Enemies)

- Lead stronger enemies toward guards or other NPCs
- Let them handle the enemy while you recover
- No shame in using the environment to your advantage

### Gear Tempering

- Temper/enchant your equipment to improve effectiveness
- Hire a blacksmith or mage to do it for you if you can't
- Better gear = more survivable fights

### Come Back Later

- **Enemies don't scale with your level** in Wildlander
- If content is too hard, recruit followers or gain levels
- Return with better skills, perks, and gear
- There is no shame in tactical retreat

### Use Followers

- **Followers are force multipliers** - They tank hits while you attack
- Recruit followers for difficult content
- Numbers matter: more allies = easier fights

## Key Principles

1. **Scout before fighting** - Knowledge prevents death
2. **Plan your engagement** - Don't wade in randomly
3. **Prioritize targets** - Kill ranged/light armor first
4. **Manage resources** - Stamina, health, magicka are finite
5. **Use positioning** - High ground, cover, and flanking win fights
6. **Don't tank hits** - Dodge, sidestep, retreat when low on health
7. **Know when to run** - Tactical retreat beats death
8. **Use your environment** - Leverage terrain, guards, and features
