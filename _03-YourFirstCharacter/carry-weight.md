# Carry Weight Management

Carry Weight is intentionally at a premium within Wildlander. In addition to reduced base carry weight:

- **Money weighs you down** - Each coin weighs 0.001 units. This weight is shown in the coin purse Misc object (this item is just a representation of your gold - you need to deposit the gold itself in a chest, not the coin purse item).
- **Arrows/Bolts have weight** - Shown in your quiver and vary by material. More "rustic" wooden-shafted arrows (iron, forsworn, steel) weigh less than rarer projectiles (Orcish, Ebony, Daedric).

Weight matters. Everything you carry—armor, weapons, potions, food, supplies—slows you down. Exceed your carry limit and you can't run, sprint, or move effectively. Manage your weight or die tired.

While you will gradually gain carry weight with [Derived Attributes](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_03-YourFirstCharacter/Derived-Attributes/), the canny adventurer still needs places to store gear. In Wildlander, carry weight is a critical resource management tool—you can't carry everything, so managing your inventory carefully is essential to successful exploration.

**The fundamental rule:** Keep your total weight as light as possible. Overencumbered characters die in combat.

## How Weight Works

### Weight Affects Combat

Your equipped gear (armor, weapons, clothing) counts toward your total mass and directly impacts:

- **Movement speed** - More weight = slower movement
- **Stamina costs** - More weight = higher stamina drain for attacks and sprinting
- **Magicka costs** - Heavy armor and weight increase spell costs
- **Sneaking** - Heavy Armor can enter stealth but is ineffective; you will likely be detected. Evasion and Clothing allow effective sneaking

### Three Armor Weight Categories

**Heavy Armor**
- High weight, high armor rating
- Slower movement, higher stamina costs
- Better stagger/knockback resistance
- **Stealth ineffective** - Can enter stealth but will likely be detected; not viable for sneaking

**Evasion (Light Armor)**
- Medium weight, medium armor rating
- Faster movement, lower stamina costs
- Less stagger/knockback resistance

**Clothing**
- Minimal weight, no armor rating
- Fastest movement, lowest spell costs, quietest
- Zero protection but maximum mobility

## Inventory Management Strategies

### The 50-Pound Rule

**Keep your carried weight at 50 pounds or below whenever possible.** This means:

1. **Only carry essential combat gear:**
   - Primary weapon (tempered)
   - Backup weapon
   - Healing potions (5-10)
   - Stamina/Magicka potions if needed

2. **Drop, breakdown or store non-essentials:**
   - Excess weapons and armor
   - Heavy books and skill books
   - Alchemy ingredients (store these—they're heavy)
   - Non-valuable loot

3. **Invest in mobile storage:**
   - Use a horse for long expeditions
   - Keep a storage chest at a safe location (home or camp)
   - Return periodically to offload excess loot

### Carrying Potions Efficiently

Potions are heavy and essential. Manage them strategically:

- **Carry only active potions** - 5-10 healing potions maximum
- **Store extras at safe locations** - Homes, containers
- **Alchemy for efficiency** - Craft stronger potions to carry fewer
- **Quick Restore hotkey (V)** - Uses potions to top you up use without opening inventory, and only uses the potions you need.

## Storage Solutions

### Safe Storage Locations

**Owned Properties (Mid-Game+)**
- Breezehome (Whiterun) - Expensive, not early-game viable
- Proudspire Manor (Solitude) - Mid-game luxury home
- Lakeview Manor (builders mod) - Craftable homestead
- ⚠️ **Note:** Homes are expensive in Wildlander and out of reach early game. Focus on other storage options while you level.

**Craftable Storage Containers**
- See [Barrels and Chests Comparison](#barrels-and-chests-comparison) below for details on the two types of craftable containers (Campfire vs. Hearthfire furniture)

**Guild Halls (Faction-Based)**
- Companions Hall (Whiterun)
- Thieves Guild (Riften)
- Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary
- College of Winterhold (mage guild)

### Barrels and Chests Comparison

**Wooden Chests/Barrels (Campfire)**
- Crafted from player crafting (Survivalist Toolkit)
- Cannot be placed in cities, towns, or settled areas
- Have linked storage (multiple chests share the same inventory)
- Can be picked up easily by interacting with the chest
- Don't have to be emptied to be moved
- Only requires wood to craft

**Hearthfire Furniture Chests**
- Placed with Hearthfire furniture crafting (requires furniture workstation)
- Can be placed anywhere
- Have separate storage (not linked)
- Require Jaxon's positioner to move
- MUST be emptied before moving or you will lose contents

#### Why are Campfire chests linked storage - Isn't this an exploit?

For technical reasons with the way the 'campfire placement' mod works, all of its chests and barrels are activators rather than chest items in their own right. The activators "open" a shared chest inside the campfire cell, rather than placing a real chest in the open world. This is simply what is required to make the mod function. As a penalty to counteract this requirement, placement is prevented within "Settled Areas".

## Campfire Skills

There is a skill available at a player constructed campfire which increases your carry weight permanently. To use it:

1. Press **<** to open the Campfire menu
2. Build a campfire and increase its size/upgrades with materials
3. Once upgraded sufficiently, interact with the campfire and a skills menu will appear
4. Select the Carry Weight skill to increase your capacity

{: .note }
This skill requires a Skill Point (earned from taking care of yourself) and has two levels total.

## Faction Safe Storage

Containers in the factions (Companions / Dark Brotherhood / Thieves Guild / Mage's College) which are marked with a **\*** are safe storage. You can safely stash your loot here. All other containers should be considered unsafe and you will lose the contents if you reload a save, or the cell resets after 30 days of you not visiting.

### Other Portable Storage

**Backpacks**
- Craftable using a Survival Toolkit through player crafting
- Worn on your back, increase carry capacity
- Different backpack types: leather, hide, fur
- Cannot be enchanted

**Horses**
- Mobile storage - Each horse has 600 carry weight and can easily carry most supplies you need
- Access horse inventory with **U** hotkey
- Horses follow you and hold items
- You can even store your craftable chest on the horse for effectively infinite storage
- Dead horses lose all items unless you can find their body and loot it before butchering it. If you have lost your horse, you have lost its inventory.
- **⚠️ WARNING:** Never store loose potions on horses. NPCs (including horses) will consume potions from their inventory if they're low on health or stamina.

For more information about horses in Wildlander, see the [Horses page](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_04WildlanderWorld/13-Horses/)

**Followers**
- Followers have their own inventory
- Only give them gear and weapons you want them to equip
- **⚠️ WARNING:** Followers will use healing potions, buff potions, and poisons if they have them—only give them potions you're willing to lose

## Weight-Reducing Strategies

### 1. Breakdown Items

- **Break down heavy items into components** - Reduces total weight by converting items into crafting materials
- Heavy armor and weapons can be broken down for ore, leather, wood, etc.
- Materials take up less weight than full items
- Use breakdown materials for crafting at workbenches

### 2. Food-Based Carry Weight Boosts

- **Eat foods that temporarily increase carry weight** - Useful before long loot runs
- **Beggar's Broth** - Increases carry weight by 35 points for 2 hours (best option)
- **Beef Stew** - Increases carry weight by 25 points for 30 minutes
- **Braided Bread** - Increases carry weight by 10 points for 20 minutes
- See [Food & Drink](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/_04WildlanderWorld/9-Food-Drink/) page for recipes and preparation

### 3. Alchemy Potions

- **Fortify Carry Weight potion** (temporary boost)
- Craft with ingredients: Imp Stool, Namira's Rot, Troll Eye
- Use before looting heavy items

### 4. Clothing Over Armor

- **Clothing weighs significantly less** than armor
- Trade protection for mobility in safe zones
- Switch loadouts as needed

### 5. Horse & Storage Chest Combo

- **Buy or craft a storage chest** - Keep at your home base or camp
- Use your horse's 600 carry weight inventory to transport items between locations
- Wear a backpack for additional personal capacity
- You can even store your craftable chest on the horse for effectively infinite mobile storage
- **Make regular supply runs** - Don't try to carry everything at once
- Perfect for long expeditions where you return to camp periodically

---

## The Encumbrance Penalty

**If you exceed your carry limit:**

- **Cannot run** - Stuck at walking speed
- **Cannot sprint** - Impossible to escape danger
- **Combat vulnerability** - Enemies outrun you easily
- **Death sentence** - Overencumbered characters die fast

**Solution:** Always drop items before exceeding your limit. Never knowingly overencumber yourself.

## Advanced Weight Management

### Enchantments for Weight

Certain enchantments reduce carried weight:

- **Fortify Carrying Capacity** - Direct carry weight increase
- **Feather** enchantments - Reduce item weight
- **Bound Armor spells** - Summon equipment (doesn't add weight)

### Spell-Based Solutions

- **Telekinesis** - Move items without carrying them
- **Bound weapons** - Summon weapons (no weight, automatic scaling)
- **Levitation** - Some mods allow levitation to reduce fall damage from jumping down with heavy loads
