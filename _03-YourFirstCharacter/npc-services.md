**You don't have to craft everything yourself.** NPCs across Skyrim offer professional crafting, tempering, and enchanting services—perfect when you've reached max gear and don't have the skills yourself.

## How NPC Services Work

Blacksmiths craft new items and temper existing equipment. Enchanters add magical properties to your gear. Both services are:

- **Skill-based:** Higher-skill NPCs produce better quality items and more powerful enchantments (but cost more)
- **Material-dependent:** Blacksmiths use their own materials; you provide rare items (dragon bones, etc.)
- **Time-intensive:** Minimum 24 hours to complete; longer if the NPC needs to acquire materials
- **Cost-scaled:** Price = material cost + NPC skill multiplier + flat fee
- **Financially rewarding:** Money goes directly to the NPC's inventory (useful for bartering)

{: .important}
> **Before Collection:** You cannot see the cost or completion time until you collect the finished item. Assume minimum 24 hours and price at 50% above the item's final value.

## Key Mechanics

### For Blacksmiths
- Will craft items you can't create yourself (requiring higher smithing perks)
- Will temper weapons/armor to improve their stats
- Use their own materials but need YOU to provide rare materials (dragon bones, ebony ingots, etc.)
- Skill level determines what equipment types they can work with
- Can adjust NPC skill levels via MCM menu if limited by available smiths

### For Enchanters
- Only know **common enchantments** (no rare effects you disenchant from artifacts)
- To add a rare enchantment, bring an item that HAS that effect and they'll learn it
- Cannot disenchant NPC-crafted items—you lose the enchantment data permanently
- Cost depends on soul gem size, their skill, and a flat fee

### Item Retrieval & Downtime
- **NPC takes your item** during crafting/tempering and holds it
- **You cannot use it** until completion (plan for 24+ hours downtime)
- **Bring a spare** if you depend on that equipment for survival
- You get it back when you pay the full cost

## Strategic Application

**When should you use NPC services?**

- **Mid-game gear upgrades:** You've outgrown starting equipment but lack smithing perks
- **Rare material use:** You found dragon bones but don't want to invest in Smithing
- **Exotic enchantments:** You want effects you don't have disenchanted items for
- **Time-sensitive gaps:** You need gear improved NOW, not after grinding Smithing

**Cost management:**
- Invest in smiths with high Barter to reduce service costs
- Use low-skill smiths for cheap repairs on non-critical gear
- Save high-skill enchanters for important equipment (weapons, main armor)
