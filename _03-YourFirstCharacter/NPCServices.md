description: NPC Crafting and Enchanting Services
---


Blacksmiths and Mages all over Skyrim are be able to craft, temper and enchant your equipment, including armor and weapons added by other mods. The quality and price of their work will depend on their skill as craftsmen as well as your barter abilities.

Blacksmiths will craft and temper at your request. Enchanters will enchant and recharge items for you.

* The skill level of the blacksmith /enchanter determines what perks they get, the type of equipment they can work with and the cost of their work. The cost will also depend on the value of the item, the local value of materials used by the NPC and your barter skill.
* If a NPC can't craft or temper an item, find another with higher skill level, or change their skill via the MCM menu.
* The higher the skill of the blacksmith the higher the stats on crafted/tempered items. Low skill smiths are cheaper, but so is their work.
* The higher the skill of the enchanter the more powerful the enchantments will be, and the costlier.
* Money used to pay for services will go straight to the blacksmith/enchanter's inventory.
* Blacksmiths will use their own materials and can acquire what they don't have at the expense of extra time and money. You'll still need to provide them with rare materials like dragon bones if you want them to craft something of that sort.
* Enchanters will only know common enchantments. If you want a different enchantment you'll need to bring an item they can get the enchantment from.
* Crafting, tempering and enchanting takes a minimum 24 hours by default. The time will increase if the NPC doesnt have the materiels on hand to do the upgrade and needs to Aquire them.
* The cost of Enchantments is calculated using the Soul Gem you choose, The skill of the enchanter, plus a flat fee. 
* The cost of crafted/tempered items is calculated using the Total material cost, The skill of the Smith, plus a flat fee. 
* The NPC will take the item from you to Temper or enchant it, and will be returned once completed when you pay for the work. Make sure you have a spare item to replace the item while you are waiting.
* For technical Reasons with how the mod works, Items enchanted by a NPC cannot be disenchanted by the player to learn the effects.  In addition, its not possible to inform the player of the cost of the Enchanters or Blacksmith's services until collection.

There is no way to tell before collection of the item, how long it will take to make/upgrade and how much it will cost to do so. Assume a Minimum of 24 hours, and the cost will be the selling price of the finished item + 50%.
