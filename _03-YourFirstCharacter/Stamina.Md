# Stamina Management

Stamina is **critical for ALL combat playstyles**—melee, ranchers, casters, and everyone else. Managing stamina effectively is the difference between victory and death.

## Why Stamina Matters

Wildlander uses **Requiem's stamina drain system**, which is much harsher than vanilla. Stamina affects:

- **Blocking** - Drains stamina with each block
- **Running** - Sprinting drains stamina quickly
- **Jumping** - Each jump costs stamina
- **Power Attacks** - Massive stamina cost
- **Armor/Shields without perks** - Heavy drain from wearing unsupported equipment
- **Holding a bow ready** - Aiming costs stamina continuously
- **Magic spells** - Severe penalties below 20% stamina (double spell cost)
- **Combat effectiveness** - Below certain thresholds, you slow down, block weakly, and deal reduced damage

**Critical Warning:** Running out of stamina in combat is often fatal. Enemies will knock weapons from your hands and may kill you while defenseless.

---

## The Stamina Threshold

When your stamina drops below a certain percentage, you face severe penalties:

- **Below 20% stamina:**
  - Movement speed severely reduced
  - Blocking effectiveness drops dramatically
  - Melee damage reduced significantly
  - Spell costs **doubled** (for mages)
  - You become an easy target

**This is why stamina management is essential from level 1.**

## Playstyle-Specific Challenges

### Melee Characters (One-Handed / Two-Handed)

You have the most stamina-intensive playstyle:

- **Never power attack early game** - The stamina cost is devastating
- **Avoid excessive blocking** - Use predictable blocks only to level Block skill to 20
- **Don't "hack and slash" frantically** - Spam attacking drains stamina fast
- **Fight smart, not hard:**
  - Observe enemy patterns
  - Sidestep instead of blocking
  - Attack when you'll actually hit (not into shields)
  - Retreat to recover stamina when low

**Early Game Tip:** Focus on positioning and timing over aggressive combat. One well-placed hit beats ten blocked attacks.

### Archer Characters (Bow/Crossbow)

Stamina drains while aiming:

- **Only aim when you intend to fire quickly** - Don't hold aim while waiting
- **Avoid sprinting** - Like melee characters, you need stamina to escape
- **Use crossbows** - They don't drain stamina while ready (unlike bows)
- **Reposition frequently** - Keep enemies at range where stamina matters less

### Caster Characters (Magic)

Magic has its own stamina penalty system:

- **Below 20% stamina: spell costs double** - Devastating for sustained spellcasting
- **You slow down significantly** - Enemies can catch and kill you
- **Manage stamina carefully** - Mages must balance spell casting with movement
- **Wear light armor** - Heavy armor drains stamina and prevents spellcasting

---

## Everyone's Golden Rule

**Don't sprint around like you're Usain Bolt. Don't jump like a rabbit. Don't waste stamina attacking into raised shields.**

Instead: **Observe. Sidestep. Attack when you'll hit. Recover when low.**

## How to Manage Stamina

### Food & Consumables

#### Stews (Highest Priority)
- **Apple Cabbage Stew** - 2 hours stamina regen boost
  - Recipe: 1 Salt, 1 Red Apple, 1 Cabbage, 1 Bottled Water
  - Cheap to make, easy to find ingredients
  - **Always carry multiple** - Use whenever stamina gets low
- **Bestial Stew** - 3 stamina/second for 3 hours
  - Only available to strong stomach races (Argonian, Khajiit, Orc, Wood Elf)
  - Major advantage if you have the race
  - Significantly better than Apple Cabbage Stew

#### Raw Ingredients (Combat)
- Eat in combat for quick stamina restoration
- Provides 1-2 stamina/second for limited duration
- Examples: meat, mushrooms, vegetables

#### Cooked Meat & Vegetables (Out of Combat)
- Eat outside of combat for 1-2 stamina/second regen
- Better ingredient management than raw foods
- Easier to cook in bulk early on

### Passive Bonuses

#### Engraved Bones (Hircine)
- Grants passive stamina regen while carried
- Permanent stamina regeneration boost
- Worth seeking out if you find one

#### Enchantments
- **Fortify Stamina Regen** - Your best early-game enchantment
- Reduces reliance on consumables
- Apply to boots, gloves, or rings
- Pairs well with stew consumables

#### Cooking Stews
- Craft Apple Cabbage Stew or other stamina-boosting recipes
- Keep a constant supply in your inventory
- Combine with other stamina management strategies

### When Stamina Won't Regenerate

If your stamina isn't regenerating at all, check your **Active Effects**:

#### Diseases
- **Cure any disease immediately** - Diseases cripple stamina regen
- Seek a temple, alchemist, or use cure disease potions
- High priority after any combat

#### Training Fatigue
- **Sleep it off** - You accumulate training fatigue from spell research and training dummies
- Rest in a bed (1 hour of training = 2 hours sleep needed)
- Cannot recover while fatigued

## Long-Term Stamina Growth

### Base Stamina
- Increases with **Endurance skill** leveling
- Higher base stamina = faster natural regeneration
- Spend time running in cold areas to passively level Endurance

### Perks Reduce Drain
As you gain perks in armor skills:
- **Heavy Armor perks** reduce stamina drain from wearing heavy armor
- **Block perks** make blocking cheaper
- **Weapon perks** make attacks more efficient
- At higher levels, stamina management becomes much easier

**Patience is key:** Early game is stamina-starved. Mid-game gets manageable. Late game becomes comfortable.
