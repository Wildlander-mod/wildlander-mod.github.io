## The Campfire

To build a campfire:

1. Place a campfire ring on the ground (Press **<** to start. With **E** to confirm placement)
1. Activate the Campfire ring
1. Add fuel
1. Add tinder
1. Light the fire

When your tinder catches the fuel, your campfire will burst to life! Add more fuel to build bigger, hotter, longer-lasting campfires.


Campfire Type|	Materials|	Duration|	Benefits|
|--|--|--|--|
Starting Campfire|	2 Branches, Kindling, or Ruined Books, Tinder|	1 Hour|	Access "Skills"|
Flickering  Campfire|	4 Branches, Kindling, or Ruined Books|	3 Hours|	Cook meat directly on campfire , use Cooking Pot|
Uplifting  Campfire|	6 Deadwood or 4 Wood|	6 Hours|	"Uplifted" - All skills improve 3% faster for 6 hours.|
Inspiring Campfire|	6 Deadwood or 4 Wood|	12 Hours|	"Inspired" - All skills improve 5% faster for 6 hours.|

Campfires can be put out. If there was any unspent fuel before the campfire was put out, it will be given to you when you click on the campfire again.

{: .NoTitleGreen}
Note: Uplifted and Inspired buffs will only apply when you leave the radius of the campfire, or the campfire goes out.

### Fuel

The starting fuels for a campfire are branches, kindling, or ruined books.

Kindling can be crafted from player crafting from most wooden objects, or from deadwood you find while Foraging

---

### Tinder

Several different items can be used as tinder. Your choice of tinder is important as it determines how long it will take to successfully light the campfire. It is much harder to light a campfire in bad weather, so being prepared by carrying high-quality tinder for when the weather turns sour is always a good idea. Tinder can be crafted from the following items in player crafting

Tinder	|Time to Light (Clear Weather)	|Time to Light (Rain, Snow, Ash Storm)
|--|--|--|
Kindling	|28 sec	|42 sec
Mora Tapinella	|21 sec	|35 sec
Canis Root	|21 sec	|35 sec
Linen cloth	|14 sec	|28 sec
Hanging Moss	|14 sec	|28 sec
Tundra Cotton	|14 sec	|28 sec
Beehive Husk	|7 sec	|21 sec
Straw 	|7 sec	|21 sec
Dwarven Oil	|1 sec	|14 sec
Lantern Oil |	1 sec	|14 sec


{: .hint}
> The time to light a campfire in all weather conditions can be improved with the Firecraft Camping perk if using Strike Stone, or the Destruction skill if using magic.

{: .highlight}
> Be careful: a starting campfire only lasts for 1 hour! Be sure to add more fuel and build a larger campfire quickly, or else your tinder and fuel will be lost and you will have to start over.
> 
> A good strategy is to already have enough fuel for at least a flickering campfire ready before you begin building a campfire. That way you won’t run the risk of your campfire burning out before you can find more fuel.

### Light your fire

To light your fire, select either Light Fire (Strike Stone) or Light Fire (Magic).

If you select Strike Stone, your Firecraft Camping perk reduces how long it takes to light your campfire (7 seconds per rank). When you light the fire, you will gain Camping skill experience.

If you select Magic, your Destruction skill reduces how long it takes to light your campfire (7 seconds for every 20 points). When you light the fire, you will gain Destruction skill experience.

## Camping Perks

When interacting with your fire - you can select the skills option.

* A red torchbug will appear near your skill tree. Selecting it will close the skill tree. The skill tree will also close if the campfire burns out or if you walk far enough away.
* Two Yellow torchbugs will appear near your skill tree. Selecting them navigates forward and back through the available skills.

### Campfire Tree

Skilled campers can build a fire even in the worst weather and make more effective use of their surroundings. Light campfires to earn perks. Each new perk requires a few more successfully lit campfires.

> * Time spent near fires, inside a tent, using Inner Fire, and otherwise in shelter will not contribute toward your Endurance skill.
> * Gaining more exposure will not cause your Endurance skill to advance faster; it is advanced strictly based on time spent surviving the elements.
> * You can respec your points at any time by accessing the SkyUI MCM and selecting Advanced > Endurance Skill > Respec Perks.


### Survival Tree

When you get any of your needs to their max value, your survival skill will increase. Each level will require you to replenish your needs more times.

## Camping Equipment

### Tents

Tents are an important piece of camping equipment. A tent can be used to sit or sleep, and your followers can sit and sleep inside them as well. They include lanterns to shed some light and are important in mods like Frostfall where being able to take shelter in the wilderness is essential.

To place a tent, use the tent in your inventory and a blue indicator will appear. The indicator will follow your movements and adjust to the slope of the ground. When you have determined where you would like to place your tent, press the confirm button and the tent will be set up.

Time to take a load off! When you sit or sleep inside a tent, some of your worn equipment will be removed and placed in and around your tent. It will be automatically re-equipped when you get up. You can choose which pieces of gear should be removed in Campfire’s configuration menu, or disable the feature entirely.

All tents come with one or more lanterns. Select your bedroll and select the Use Lantern option to turn it on or off.

There are two main types of tent, Leather - which is cooler, but protects better againt rain. or Fur, which is warmer but can become soaked though in rainy conditions. 

### Bedrolls

The cheaper option for if you want to sleep inside of a building or cave - Placed in much the same way as Tents - but do not protect you from rain or snow.

### Cooking pot

Can be crafted near a forge using player crafting - when using a campfire with a cookpot in your inventory - you can use this item to cook stews at your campfire.

### Rustic Furniture

Allows the crafting placement of a more comfortable bed, Table or chair - for when you decide to make a permanent home of a dungeon or cave.

### Chests and barrels

Can be crafted near a forge using player crafting - Can be placed to provide unlimited storage. Covered in more detail on the [Carry weight mechanics](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/03-YourFirstCharacter/carry-weight/) page
