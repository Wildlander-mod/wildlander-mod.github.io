## Breaking Down Items

Breakdown crafting allows you to deconstruct items into their component materials. This is one of your most important tools for resource management.

### How to Break Down Items

**Default Hotkey:** Press `?` (question mark key) while holding an item to open the breakdown menu.

### What You Get

When you break down items, you receive valuable materials such as:

- **Metal Fragments** - From breaking down metal armor and weapons
- **Leather** - From breaking down leather armor and gear  
- **Cloth & Bandages** - From breaking down clothing and fabric items
- **Bone Fragments** - From breaking down bones and bone items
- **Kindling** - From breaking down wooden items (useful for starting campfires)
- **Specialized Materials** - Many other material types available - See the [Breakdown Recipes](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/10-Crafting/Breakdown-Recipes.html) spreadsheet for the complete list

### Why Breakdown Matters

1. **Inventory Management** - Convert bulky items into compact materials to stay under carry weight limits
2. **Resource Recovery** - Get valuable materials back from unwanted gear instead of selling it
3. **Crafting Supply** - Build up material stockpiles for blacksmithing, leatherworking, and other crafts
4. **Early Game Income** - Break down found items for materials you can sell

### Tips

- Break down old or damaged gear regularly to free up inventory space
- Metal fragments and bandages are very valuable - collect them
- Cloth and leather scraps are surprisingly valuable - don't waste them
- Use breakdown to manage weight during long adventures
- Check the [Breakdown Recipes](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/10-Crafting/Breakdown-Recipes.html) spreadsheet to see exactly what each item breaks down into
