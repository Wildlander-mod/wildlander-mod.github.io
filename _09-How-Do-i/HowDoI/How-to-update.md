## Clean Install of Mods (optional, but recommended) 

Perform a clean install - Delete your Game-files\Mods folder before continuing (the folder circled in the example below).**  

The reason for this is Wabbajack reads through and CRC checks everything in the mods folder. Unfortunately this process takes a long time to do, and can't detect corrupted files 100% of the time.
