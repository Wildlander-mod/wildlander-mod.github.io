## Fast Travel

### Why is Fast Travel Disabled?

Fast travel is disabled by default in Wildlander to encourage exploration and survival mechanics. Walking the land forces you to:
- Experience the world and discover locations naturally
- Manage resources (food, water, warmth) during travel
- Encounter random encounters and dangers
- Maintain immersion in the survival aspect

### How to Re-Enable Fast Travel

If you want to enable fast travel, you need to configure these MCM settings:

1. **Frostfall** - Edit in MCM
2. **Requiem** - Edit in MCM
3. **Sunhelm** - Edit in MCM

Additionally, in version 1.1.0 and later, a SKSE mod disables fast travel globally. To disable this restriction:

**File Location:** `game-files\mods\Disable Fast Travel SKSE - No Janky Map UI\SKSE\Plugins\DisableFastTravel.ini`

### Before You Enable It

{: .warning}
Disabling survival features may reduce the intended difficulty and immersion. Consider trying at least a few hours of gameplay with travel disabled before enabling it.
