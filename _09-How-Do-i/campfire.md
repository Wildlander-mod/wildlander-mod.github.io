If you hit the Campfire, or try to place a chest/tent or other object by accident, you can cancel placement by hitting the "E" key.

Depending on where you are - you will either be told you cant place the item in a settled area, and the placement will cancel automatically or you will be asked if you are sure you want to place the item here - Just answer no.
