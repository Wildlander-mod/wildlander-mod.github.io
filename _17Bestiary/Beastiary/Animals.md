Before we shall delve in details, let it be noted that almost any animal (with the exception of domesticated) might be infected with potent diseases that could even cause a mighty warrior to decay within days. Thus, I can only advise you to have the means at hand to cure such vile afflictions, as they can affect the victim's body almost immediately after the contraction, as they posses a truly unique magical nature.

## Domesticated animals

{: .hint}
> **Threat Level: 🟢 Trivial**
> 
> Harmless livestock and companion animals found in settlements. No combat threat whatsoever. Killing them incurs bounties. Diseased variants exist but are non-hostile.

Domesticated animals are usually found in camps, villages, cities or occasionally wandering about alone. If these animals are harmed or stolen (in the case of horses), the Dragonborn will earn a bounty in that hold or city.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* They're not your enemy—avoid harming them unless absolutely necessary
* Most are not diseased, but some (Dogs) can carry Chills
* Some (Horses) can be ridden as mounts
* Killing them incurs bounties in the local hold

### **Mammoth**

{: .warning}
> **Threat: 🔴 Dangerous**
> 
> Colossal creatures with exceptional health (3000), heavy armor, and devastating tusk attacks. Solo melee engagement is suicide. Paralysis immunity and high armor penetration make them extremely dangerous. Avoid or use coordinated ranged/magic tactics.

Mammoths are found a plenty on the plains of Skyrim, either roaming the land wildly or being domesticated by the local giants. They're most likely the biggest animals that walk the landscape, and their steps can make the very earth tremble. Their thick skin and pure mass of muscles and strong bones gives them exceptionally high resistances to damage of all sorts, and common arrows most likely won't do them much harm as they hardly can injure important organs - because of this, they're best killed by fighting them in groups or luring them into traps like spike pits. It is highly advisable to not engage in melee combat, as a single blow of their mighty tusks can penetrate armor easily and impale even a hardened orcish veteran.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Solo melee engagement is suicide—DO NOT engage unless with group or traps
* Tusk attacks penetrate armor easily and apply tusk damage (175 base)
* They can knockdown you; expect frequent staggers—prepare recovery abilities
* High armor penetration (50 AP) means heavy armor protection is reduced
* Use ranged magic at distance or coordinated group tactics with traps
* Frost and poison resistance reduce spell effectiveness significantly

### **Bristleback** 

{: .hint}
> **Threat: 🟡 Difficult**
> 
> Moderately dangerous boar-like predator with high melee damage (150) but no special resistances. Manageable with proper tactics but dangerous in melee. Magic or ranged attacks recommended.

## Predators

{: .hint}
> **Threat Level: 🟢-🟡 Average to Difficult**
> 
> Aggressive carnivores that hunt actively. Threat ranges from trivial (Skeevers) to dangerous (Sabre Cats, Bears). Most are manageable solo but dangerous in packs. Disease is common among predators.

### Skeevers

{: .hint}
> **Threat: 🟢 Trivial**
> 
> Tiny vermin with negligible damage output. Disease is the only real threat. Not a combat concern.

Looking somewhat like the giant rats that dwell in Cyrodiil, Morrowind, Highrock and other provinces, Skeevers are the representation of these creatures in the land of Skyrim. They are rather small and a little skittish and will only prove to be a nuisance for anyone who can (and does) carry a weapon of any sort.

### Horkers

{: .hint}
> **Threat: 🟢 Average**
> 
> Slow, heavily armored marine predators with significant melee damage. Their low speed is their primary vulnerability—use ranged attacks or keep distance. Not a serious threat to a prepared player.

Horkers are a common form of life at Skyrim's coasts. Their appearance is somewhat hard to describe, as no similar creature has ever been seen in all of Tamriel. They're very slow beings that only attack when feeling threatened - although they can be fought very easily with ranged weaponry because of their lack of fast movement, one should not dare to underestimate the force of their tusks, as they certainly are capable of killing a human-like being with just a few blows. Also, their body is very durable, consisting of thick layers of muscles and fat, which makes them die rather slowly if not hit very powerfully. Whatever way one chooses to approach them, it should be mentioned that their fat can be used as a substitute for troll fat, as they basically share the same magical properties.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Their extreme slowness is exploitable—attack from range or maintain distance
* Frost resist makes cold damage ineffective
* Use physical damage or fire-based attacks
* Don't underestimate their tusk damage in melee; keep distance

*Weaknesses*

### Wolves

{: .hint}
> **Threat: 🟢 Average (Solo) → 🟡 Difficult (Packs)**
> 
> Fast, coordinated pack hunters with moderate damage. Individual wolves are easily managed but groups are dangerous. Their leap attack has significant range—dodge sideways or bash to interrupt.

Probably the most common creature in Skyrim's forests and tundra, the Wolf is a dangerous beast that moves very fast and can kill with a few strong bites, but even a novice in the arts of combat should have no great challenge to kill one or two of them. However, if they are attacking in packs, they'll try to outmaneuver their prey, which can prove to be fatal to even more experienced adventurers - it is crucial to look out for them, and if possible, kill them with ranged weaponry.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Dodge sideways just before their leap attack—practice timing to avoid damage
* Bash them mid-air to interrupt their leap
* In packs, prioritize one wolf at a time and use area attacks
* Ranged weapons are most effective to manage pack coordination
* Watch for disease on successful hits

### Mudcrabs

{: .hint}
> **Threat: 🟢 Average**
> 
> Heavily armored predators with limited threat due to low speed and damage. Very hard carapace resists physical weapons—magic and blunt weapons are effective. Size determines threat: small are trivial, large are moderate.

As in many other provinces, mudcrabs can also be found in Skyrim, though their appearance differs from those that dwell in the lands of Cyrodiil and Morrowind, as their carapaces tend to be blue-gray and lack the common green-brown tone. Depending on their age, Skyrim's mudcrabs can be found in many sizes, from very small to very large, though they rarely become any bigger. Although there are claims of at least one mudcrab being as tall as a house in Skyrim's northern coast regions, these most likely are fairytales. Their size determines their overall strength in combat - the bigger they are, the harder they are to kill and the harder they hit. When facing them, magical damage is the best way to deal with them, as their very hard carapaces provide an exceptional amount of protection that will withstand most common weapons. If magic is not available, a skilled warrior might also try a mace or some other form of blunt weapon, as the sheer force of such blows can damage the internal organs of these creatures, rendering their protection practically useless.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Slashing weapons are ineffective (Tier 2-3 protection)—use magic or blunt weapons
* Very slow movement—exploit with ranged attacks
* Size scaling: small are weak, large pose moderate threat
* High armor rating but low melee damage makes them low-risk
* Magic damage bypasses carapace armor completely

### Bears

{: .hint}
> **Threat: 🟡 Difficult**
> 
> Fast, powerful predators with high melee damage and knockdown capability. Can sprint quickly—don't rely on outrunning them. Magical or ranged attacks are strongly preferred. Diseased variants are common.

Skyrim is home of many bears, with many variations depending on the given territory. As worldly creatures, they do not possess any magical traits worth mentioning - however, any wanderer should show the greatest amount of caution when close to these beasts, as they can run very fast - faster than one might think! And they certainly are able to tear an unarmored foe to shreds if they are able to hit them with their sharp claws. The best way to deal with them certainly is through magic or another form of ranged combat. It also should be noticed that some of their intestines, especially their hearts, can be used in alchemical experiments, as can their claws.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Their speed belies their threat—keep distance and use ranged/magic
* Knockdown attacks are frequent; prepare defensive abilities
* Snow bears have frost resistance (50%)—use fire or physical damage
* Diseased variants are common; cure disease potions are essential
* They have high weapon penetration resistance (Tier 4)—magic is more effective

> Agile, deadly predators with moderate health and very high damage. Their knockdown charge attack is lethal—dodge/block it at all costs or risk instant death. Fast enough that distance is unreliable. Coordinates attacks; dangerous in pairs.

Sabrecats are a terror to behold, as they're both fast and deadly - although they do not withstand as many blows as bears, they still are hard to kill if they're not surprised by the attacker. They should only be approached by experienced hunters, as they'll tear anyone to shreds who is unfortunate enough to be exposed to their claws.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Their knockdown charge attack is LETHAL—you MUST dodge or block it; getting caught means death
* Snow sabrecats will surprise-attack from stealth; stay alert in snowy areas
* High movement speed means ranged evasion is unreliable—use terrain or face them directly
* In pairs: focus one down first; don't get caught between them
* Higher tier weapon piercing resistance; magic is more efficient than weapons

### SlaughterFish
As they can be found in many provinces, Slaughterfish are also a common sight in Skyrim's waters. Their teeth are as sharp as they are anywhere else, though, and can tear flesh from bone effortlessly. It's highly advised not to venture too far into these waters - if it's necessary, they should be lured to a good position and then be dispatched with arrows. The best option is, however, to blast them to smitherines with a fireball or something similar, as these creatures generally die rather quickly. A rather rare form of this specimen, the giant slaughterfish, has been reported to be seen from time to time in the lands of Skyrim, though they generally can only be found in the oceans. These monstrosities are a whole other form of challenge, as they can even destroy entire ships with their gigantic jaws. Those who are unfortunate enough to face such things most likely are about to be swallowed whole.
