## Potema: Wolf Queen of the North

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 DIFFICULT**
> 
> A legendary necromancer and conjurer with powerful summons but critically low health (385—the lowest of all bosses). Potema is a glass cannon: extremely fragile but capable of devastating offense through summons and Lightning Cloak. The fight is essentially a race: kill her before her summons overwhelm you. Her low physical defense (no armor) and low stamina (90) mean she relies entirely on magic and summons for survival. Direct engagement typically ends fights quickly if you can reach her.

## The Defining Threat

**Summon Spam (Mandatory Multitarget Management)**: Summons powerful Reanimated Corpses and Storm Atronachs (60s duration each). Managing up to 2-3 active summons while fighting Potema means dealing with constant incoming damage from multiple targets. Summons tank your damage while she continues casting.

**Lightning Cloak (60s, 12 shock/s damage)**: Creates a persistent AoE around her that applies 12/s shock damage + magicka drain to nearby targets. Standing in melee range causes 12 damage per second (in addition to her spell damage). This incentivizes ranged engagement.

**Lightning Bolt + Sparks Spell Spam**: Lightning Bolt (25 shock to health, 12.5 to magicka) and Sparks (20/s shock AoE) are continuous threats. Magicka drain is significant—mages lose magicka faster than they can cast spells.

**Extremely Low Health (385 total)**: Lowest health pool of all boss encounters. A single strong hit or coordinated damage burst kills her instantly. She must be protected by summons or killed before taking meaningful damage.

**Extremely Low Stamina (90 total)**: Cannot use power attacks, cannot run extended distances. She relies on magic and summons instead of physical capability. However, her low stamina means she has no stamina-based escape mechanics (no power bashing, etc.).

## Counter Strategies

1. **Ranged Burst Damage (Primary Strategy—Recommended)**:
   - 385 health = ~4 arrows at 100 damage each, or ~4 spell casts at 100 damage
   - Kill her before she summons or before summons become overwhelming
   - Ranged engagement also keeps you outside Lightning Cloak range (12-16 feet)
   - Bow strategies: High-damage arrows (shock arrows bypass some resistances)
   - Spell strategies: Shock spells synergize with her weak magicka resistance
   - Timing: Kill her before turn 2 (before summons fully manifest)

2. **Summon Elimination First (Tanking Strategy)**:
   - Kill summoned creatures immediately when spawned
   - Each destroyed summon = less incoming damage
   - However, this extends fight duration significantly (each summon has 200-300 HP)
   - While you're killing summons, she casts more summons
   - This strategy is often worse than burst damage—not recommended
   - Only viable if your damage is extremely low and you must survive long-term

3. **Shock Resistance Stacking (Defensive Approach)**:
   - Her Lightning Cloak and spells are shock-only
   - 50%+ shock resistance makes her cloak essentially harmless (6/s vs 12/s)
   - Focus on surviving spell spam while dealing damage
   - Combine with moderate DPS (30+) to gradually wear her down
   - This converts fight to pure attrition; very long but guaranteed safe
   - Requires gear investment in shock resistance

4. **Melee Engagement (High Risk/High Reward)**:
   - Charge her directly in melee range
   - Her low health means 2-3 heavy hits kill her
   - However, Lightning Cloak deals continuous damage and summons attack
   - Requires high burst damage (80+ per hit) to kill before summons overwhelm
   - Not recommended for low-damage builds
   - Best for weapons with shock enchantments (synergizes with her design)

5. **Invisibility Approach (Assassination)**:
   - Sneak within melee range while invisible
   - One power attack with shock enchantment kills her
   - She cannot see you while cloaking spell animations
   - This is the safest strategy if you have Invisibility potions or spells
   - Does not require high damage output
   - Recommended for pure assassins or bow builds

## Critical Mechanics

- **385 Health (Lowest Boss)**: Extreme fragility; burst damage is highly effective
- **90 Stamina (Extremely Low)**: Cannot perform stamina-intensive actions; relies on magic
- **Lightning Cloak (60s, 12/s AoE shock)**: Persistent area denial around her; ranged preferable
- **Summon Duration (60s each)**: Multiple summons can be active; up to 3 creatures in arena
- **30% Magic Resistance (Base)**: Lightning spells penetrate somewhat; shock damage is moderately effective
- **No Armor Rating**: She has zero armor; any hit deals full damage (no reduction)
- **Unrelenting Force Shout**: She can shout you back (knockdown), but this is a long casting time
- **Reanimated Corpse Summon (varies)**: Quality depends on available corpses; can range from weak to medium-strength
- **Storm Atronach Summon (60s duration)**: Strong elemental summon; prioritize killing or position around it
- **Lesser Ward Spell**: She casts protective shield (40 physical + 40 spell damage negation); brief defensive action
