Dragons in Wildlander are not the easy to kill creatures they were in vanilla. They are heavily armored, magic-breathing flying tanks with teeth which can cut through low to mid quality armor with one bite. You might think you can send a follower to the teeth end while you rain damage down on the tail—think again, as the tail is capable of knockdowns.

{: .important}
> **Core Philosophy:** The trick to fighting any dragon isn't stats—it's tactics. Being 100 skill in everything isn't enough to guarantee your survival if you miss a block. At lower levels, even if a dragon's attacks can 1-shot you, it's possible to take them down by appropriately timed dodges, hiding, and enough equipment.

### Combat Tactics

1. **Choose your battlefield:** In most cases, you have some control over where the fight occurs. Even if a dragon swoops in on you, there is a small window to reposition yourself. Try to pick an area that has several pieces of full cover (tall enough to fully block their breath weapon from both the ground and a low hover). Ideally, this cover can be circled (in case the dragon lands/hovers behind you), and is in such a spot that the dragon cannot land on top of you. Practice this at word walls, where the wall itself can be used as cover.

2. **Cover is life:** A dragon cannot kill what it cannot hit. Make sure that there is always at least a piece of full cover adjacent to you so you can duck behind it in that split second before the dragon breathes. The Become Ethereal shout is especially useful for those "Oh shit" moments when you get caught out of cover.

3. **Patience is a virtue:** Dragons aren't short fights, so resist the urge to leave your cover spot to deal damage—all it takes is a single bad move, the dragon to turn around and bite your face off to end a long fight (and not in your favor). A dragon has the advantage in terms of stats; the only advantage you have is your brain.

4. **Know when to run:** Sometimes, it just isn't your time to shine. Don't be afraid of a tactical withdrawal, either to fully flee or to regroup. Just make sure that you do it carefully (sticking to cover). Also, if 2 dragons engage you at once...NOPE the hell outta there. They WILL kill you.

5. **Choose the right time of day:** You don't want to be attacking a dragon as the sun is setting.

> **Equipment & Resources That Help**
>
> Depending on your build, some of these become more necessary than others. You don't need all of them:
>
> * Solid, properly enchanted armor—for HA characters, the more armor the better
> * High Magic Resistance—shouts can't one-shot you if you resist 99% of the damage
> * Tanky follower(s)—to keep the "teeth end" occupied
> * Excellent ranged damage (bow, crossbow, or Destruction magic)—also properly enchanted
> * Lots of very good poison for your bow
> * Marked for Death shout—to reduce their armor
> * A good shield and block perks can block shouts
> * Become Ethereal shout—for those "Oh Shit" moments when another dragon shows up
> * Slow Time shout—really useful if you cast Marked for Death then Slow Time as melee—lets you get a lot of hits in and take off a good chunk of health
> * Indomitable Force perk—halves damage and duration of shouts, thus reducing shout damage to a quarter of the original
> * Great Resist potions (Fire, Ice, Poison)—many players treat shop vendors like vanilla garbage disposals, but don't. Check their inventory because they sell items that will save your life

### Melee vs Ranged

Ranged damage is far safer than melee. Even if the dragon lands, resist the temptation to run in to score a few whacks unless you are properly prepared—it often ends with you rag-dolling across the ground. A bow might take longer, but it will keep you 100% more alive.

That being said, dragons can be fought in melee range with the right preparation. Dragons twist their head to your left before every bite, so that's your red flag to either run away or block (obviously keep your stamina and health in mind). Blocking works fine too for dragons. With just Improved Blocking, Strong Grip, and Experienced Blocking you can block the damage from a bite if you fail to run away fast enough.

### Stealth

Dragons are NOT stealth immune, but they have very good eyesight when flying. It's nearly impossible to sneak attack a flying dragon at low to mid levels of sneak.

## Standard Fire

{: .hint}
> **Threat Level: 🟢 Low**
> 
> Most common dragon encounter in Wildlander. Manageable with proper tactics and preparation. Primary weakness is frost damage and cold-based effects.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Use frost potions or Frost Breath shout to weaken them
* Their Fire Breath is avoidable with proper positioning behind cover
* Generally weak individually—engage when you're ready
* Lower armor rating than other dragon types makes ranged attacks effective

**Variations by Color**

*(Reference table showing health/damage variations. Tactics remain the same regardless of color.)*

## Standard Frost
{: .hint}
> **Threat Level: 🟢 Low**
> 
> Common variant with slowing breath effect. Manageable with proper tactics and preparation. Primary weakness is fire damage and heat-based effects.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* The 50% slow effect is dangerous—stay mobile and use cover
* Fire potions are essential; burn effect counters their frost resistance
* Kite around obstacles to avoid breath attacks and slowing effects
* Can be soloed but the slowing breath makes mistakes more costly

**Variations by Color**

*(Reference table showing health/damage variations. Tactics remain the same regardless of color.)*

## Poison

{: .hint}
> **Threat Level: 🟢 Low**
> 
> Unique mechanics with low health and damage, but continuous health drain is dangerous if you're caught without poison resistance. Poison immunity protects them from conventional poison damage.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Low health makes them easiest to kill, but health drain is insidious
* Poison resistance potions STRONGLY recommended
* Stay in cover and use ranged attacks to avoid prolonged exposure
* Their low melee damage means blocking can save you if caught out

*Basic Stats*

|Stat| Value |

|Health| 7200 |

*Weapon Protection: See [Common Weapon Protection Values](#common-weapon-protection-values)*

## Undead

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 Moderate**
> 
> Significantly harder than standard dragons. Much higher health pool and immunity to many common tactics. Silver weapons are critical for efficient damage. Only encountered in Labyrinthian dungeon.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* **Silver weapons are MANDATORY** - standard weapons deal 20% damage
* High armor and damage reduction—expect long fights
* Immune to sneak attacks and many shout effects
* Lower melee damage than fire/frost variants (only 350) is their weakness
* Prepare for attrition: bring supplies and patience

## Serpentine

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 Moderate**
> 
> Serpentine dragons are significantly more powerful variants of standard dragons. Higher damage output and additional shout variety (Disarm) makes them more dangerous. Stats and resistances mirror their standard fire/frost counterparts.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Treat as an upgrade to Standard dragons—expect harder fights
* Higher damage (450 vs 400-525) makes mistakes more costly
* Disarm shout can catch you unprepared—have a backup weapon or shield
* Apply same elemental resistance strategy as their standard counterparts
* Generally found in higher-difficulty areas

**For complete details, see [Alduin's dedicated page](https://wiki.wildlandermod.com/17Bestiary/Bestiary/Alduin/)**
