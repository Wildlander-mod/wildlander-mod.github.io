## Malkoran: Master of Frost & Undeath

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 DIFFICULT**
> 
> A powerful necromancer who combines frost magic with extended summoning and healing capabilities. Malkoran has relatively low health (450) but compensates through Cognitively Flexible 2 (maintains 3 summons) and Improved Healing (25% stronger healing spells). The defining fight mechanic is managing multiple Ghostly Dragon Priest summons (300s duration each!) combined with his Icy Sphere AoE and self-healing loop. While individually weaker than other bosses, the summon count makes him dangerous through attrition.

## The Defining Threat

**Ghostly Dragon Priest Summons (300s Duration, up to 3 active)**: His summons are not temporary—they persist for 5 minutes (300 seconds). With Cognitive Flexibility 2, he maintains 3 independent summons simultaneously. Each Ghostly Dragon Priest has 80/s health regen + frost immunity + spellcasting. Managing 4 targets (Malkoran + 3 Dragon Priests) is mandatory.

**Icy Sphere Continuous Cast (40/s frost damage, 35% slow)**: Deals 40 frost damage per second to health and stamina simultaneously. 35% slow for 5 seconds + small stagger. Multiple casts stack slows, creating extended immobility phases.

**Healing Loop (Greater Ward + Healing Hands + Absorb Essence)**: Greater Ward absorbs 80 spell damage and grants paralyze immunity. Healing Hands heals everyone in radius (50 points) for extended duration. Absorb Essence drains 30 health/magicka/stamina from target. Combined, he can heal 50-80/s while preventing spell casts through wards.

**Stone of Atronach (reflects spells)**: He equipped Stone of Atronach. Incoming spells have chance to be reflected as projectiles back at you. This is a soft counter to pure mage builds.

**Cryomancy 2 (30% frost damage boost)**: All frost spells deal 30% bonus damage. Icy Sphere does ~52/s instead of 40/s when accounting for this multiplier.

## Counter Strategies

1. **Summon Elimination Priority (Melee Focus)**:
   - Kill Ghostly Dragon Priests before they take over the arena
   - Each summon takes ~15-20 seconds to destroy (moderate health)
   - After 45-60 seconds, you'll have eliminated all existing summons
   - New summons he casts will be single-target, not triple
   - Focus: Kill summons → Kill Malkoran → Eliminate any remaining summons
   - This is the only viable strategy for low-damage builds

2. **Frost Resistance Stacking (Defensive Approach)**:
   - His Icy Sphere is frost-only
   - 50%+ frost resistance reduces damage from 40/s to 20/s
   - Combined with healing, if you deal 30+ DPS you still win
   - Frost resistance also reduces slow effect (50% slow becomes 25%)
   - Gear for frost resistance; fight becomes winnable through attrition
   - Recommended for pure physical builds

3. **Ranged Engagement (Safe Distance)**:
   - Maintain 40+ feet distance; his summons and spells have range but slow travel time
   - Icy Sphere travels 20 feet/second; ranged engagement keeps you outside
   - His melee damage is only 5 base + 84 from staff (trivial if ranged)
   - Bow damage is not frost-resisted, so it applies fully
   - Very safe but requires sustained DPS to outlast healing (40-50 DPS needed)
   - Extremely long fights (10+ minutes typical) but guaranteed safe

4. **Healing Loop Disruption (Specialist)**:
   - Greater Ward absorbs 80 damage before actual healing activates
   - Break his ward first, then focus on direct damage
   - Continuous spell damage (DoTs) bypasses wards partially
   - Poison damage is NOT resisted; poison DoT combats his healing
   - This is difficult to execute but can end fights quickly if successful

5. **Summon Dueling (Echo Counter)**:
   - Summon your own creatures to balance the arena (1:1 summon ratio)
   - Spawn summons faster than he can re-summon (Cognitive Flexibility doesn't prevent destruction)
   - Essentially becomes summon-vs-summon war while you maintain DPS
   - Requires investment in summoning magic
   - Viable alternative to direct summoning but less efficient

## Critical Mechanics

- **3 Ghostly Dragon Priest Summons (300s duration, 80/s regen each)**: Most dangerous aspect; summoned creatures have independent health regen
- **Icy Sphere (40/s frost damage, 35% slow, small stagger)**: Primary offensive tool; sustained AoE threat
- **Greater Ward (80 damage absorption, paralyze immunity)**: Defensive spell that extends survival
- **Improved Healing (25% stronger healing spells)**: Healing Hands heals 50 + 25% = 62.5 points (approximately)
- **Respite Perk (healing restores stamina too)**: Unlimited resource regeneration through healing
- **Absorb Essence (30 life/magicka/stamina drain)**: Drains all three attributes simultaneously
- **Stone of Atronach (reflects spells)**: Incoming projectile spells reflected as projectiles back to caster
- **Deep Freeze Perk (frost spells can freeze)**: Low chance but can lock targets in place
- **Cryomancy 2 (30% frost damage boost)**: Icy Sphere effectively deals 52/s vs listed 40/s
- **Stability (50% longer duration for Alteration spells)**: Greater Ward lasts 50% longer (normally longer durations)
- **10% Weakness to Magic (base)**: Magic damage is slightly amplified (1.1x); pure mage advantage
- **Necromancy Perk (50% longer summon duration, 3x higher level reanimations)**: Explains 300s Dragon Priest duration
- **Cognitive Flexibility 2 (maintain 3 summons of any type)**: Allows unlimited summon count compared to normal limit
