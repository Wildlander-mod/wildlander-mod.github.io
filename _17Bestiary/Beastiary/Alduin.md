## Alduin: The World Eater

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 LETHAL**
> 
> The primordial dragon and architect of the apocalypse. Alduin represents the ultimate endgame threat with exceptional health (16,580), devastating shouts, and phase-based invulnerability while flying. This encounter changes based on quest context—Alduin's Bane (trapped on ground) vs Sovngarde (unlimited flying). Never engage unprepared or with unfinished builds.

## The Defining Threat

**Flying Invulnerability Phases**: Alduin becomes completely immune to all damage while airborne. In the Alduin's Bane quest, he's forced to land periodically, but in Sovngarde, he can remain flying indefinitely, rendering ground-based strategies useless.

**Drain Vitality Shout**: Applies -5 stamina, -5 magicka, -5 health per second for 60 seconds with stagger. This triple drain is catastrophic for sustained fights—he'll empty your resources while dealing passive damage.

**Dragon Storm Call**: Summons meteor shower dealing 10 damage/second over 600 seconds. Creates persistent environmental hazard that covers entire battleground.

**Quest-Context Variants**:
- **Alduin's Bane**: Limited flying, forced landings, single combat
- **Sovngarde**: Unlimited flying, summons 24 Wrathments, multiple reinforcements from Tsun/NPCs

## Counter Strategies

1. **Alduin's Bane (Ground Phase Exploitation)**: 
   - Maximize melee/archer DPS during forced landings
   - Use Unrelenting Force/Marked for Death to interrupt flying attempts
   - Prepare burst damage for 3-5 second windows when he lands
   - Drain Vitality is less threatening with full stamina/magicka pools—keep topped off

2. **Sovngarde (Attrition & Positioning)**:
   - This is primarily an NPC fight; focus on staying alive while Tsun/allies damage him
   - Use ranged attacks from terrain that blocks meteors (buildings, terrain features)
   - Manage Storm Call hazard by relocating between meteor waves
   - Wrathment summons are priority targets if they reach you; keep distance

3. **All Phases (Sustained Combat)**:
   - Shock resistance (33%) is lowest; use shock magic to counter-damage effectively
   - Heavy armor reduces melee threat but leaves you vulnerable to Drain Vitality spam
   - Magic resistance helps with shout damage but can't be stacked high enough to ignore
   - This is a long fight—bring magicka/stamina potions or prepare restoration builds

## Critical Mechanics

- **Paralysis Immunity**: Standard crowd control won't work; force gameplay through positioning
- **70-85% Damage Reduction**: Melee builds suffer heavily; enchanted weapons/perks mandatory
- **Poison Immunity (80%)**: Poison damage strategies are essentially useless
- **Knock Down Immunity (Minor)**: You will not stagger or knockdown Alduin; build accordingly
- **Quest Variance**: Sovngarde wraiths (24 total) fundamentally change threat profile—not a 1v1
