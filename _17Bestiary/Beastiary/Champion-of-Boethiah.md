## Champion of Boethiah: Servant of the Mad God

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 DIFFICULT**
> 
> A skilled warrior wearing heavy Ebony Mail armor who relies on a vampire health absorb enchantment for sustain. While his skill (Ebony Mace, shield) is solid, his health pool (550) is modest by boss standards. The defining threat is his Vampire enchantment (25 health absorption per hit)—this means he heals while damaging you, creating an attrition check. If you can outpace his healing, this is a straightforward fight. If you cannot, you'll gradually lose the war of HP.

## The Defining Threat

**Vampire Enchantment (25 HP Drain/Absorb per hit)**: Every melee hit he lands heals him for 25 HP while damaging you. If he lands 3 hits per second, he heals 75/s. This is relatively modest compared to other bosses, but it's still a healing mechanic that extends fights.

**Ebony Mail Armor (990 AR + 270 shield)**: Heavy armor provides substantial protection. However, with 550 health, burst damage can still kill him despite the armor.

**Penetrating Strikes Perk (50% lower power attack cost, +5 AP)**: He can power attack frequently without stamina penalty. Each power attack hits harder and penetrates armor slightly (only +5 AP is modest).

**Mace Focus (15 armor penetration, 1.05x damage)**: Modest damage multiplier; not a significant threat multiplier but increases effective DPS slightly.

## Counter Strategies

1. **Burst Damage (Primary Strategy)**:
   - 550 health is low enough that burst damage kills him before healing becomes relevant
   - Focus on maximizing per-hit damage (heavy weapons, enchantments, buffs)
   - His vampire healing only matters if the fight extends; end it quickly
   - Recommended: Two-handed weapons or shock/fire enchanted melee
   - If you deal 80+ DPS, healing is negligible; fight lasts <10 seconds

2. **Outpace Healing via Superior DPS**:
   - If you deal 100 DPS and he heals 75/s via vampirism
   - Net: 25 DPS advantage = 22 seconds to kill (550 ÷ 25)
   - Achievable with solid gear; this is intended difficulty level
   - Focus on consistent sustained damage rather than burst
   - Ranged strategies work here; bow damage (slightly reduced) still exceeds healing

3. **Armor Penetration Build (Optimized)**:
   - His 990 AR (high) can be overwhelmed with 75%+ penetration
   - Penetration perks + enchantments combine multiplicatively
   - Combined with decent base damage = high effective DPS
   - This specialization eliminates the healing problem
   - Viable but requires specific perk investment

4. **Restoration Healing (Attrition Matching)**:
   - If you heal 100/s and he heals 75/s, net advantage is 25/s to you
   - Restoration builds can match or exceed his healing loop
   - This converts fight to a pure attrition match; he cannot win
   - Requires Restoration 100 and multiple healing spells
   - Not the most efficient but guarantees victory through resource war

5. **Elemental Damage (Weakness Exploitation, if any)**:
   - No documented elemental weaknesses on Champion
   - However, Shock/Fire enchantments improve effective DPS regardless
   - Combined with physical damage: base + elemental = higher total DPS
   - Not a primary strategy but reinforces burst approaches

## Critical Mechanics

- **Vampire Enchantment (25 HP absorption per hit)**: Not massive but still relevant to fight duration
- **Ebony Mail Armor (990 AR + shield)**: Significant protection requiring penetration or high base damage
- **Powerful Strike (1.2x power attack damage)**: Power attacks deal 20% bonus damage
- **Stunning Charge (forward power attacks knock down)**: Can knock you down if he closes distance with charging power attacks
- **Penetrating Strikes (50% lower PA cost, +5 AP)**: He can power attack frequently; each penetrates slightly
- **Mace Focus I (1.05x damage, +15 AP)**: Small damage increase (+5% to weapon damage)
- **Knockdown Capable**: His charging power attacks can stun-lock you briefly
- **550 Health (Low for Bosses)**: Lowest health pool among boss encounters; burst damage is very effective
- **Melee-Only**: No ranged or magic threats; fight is pure melee engagement
