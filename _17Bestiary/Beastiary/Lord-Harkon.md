## Lord Harkon: Vampire Lord & Daedric Servant

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 DANGEROUS**
> 
> An ancient vampire with mastery of Daedric magic and multiple summons. Harkon combines drain life/vampiric drain damage absorption with ranged summons (Gargoyle, Revenant, Reanimate) that split your focus. Fire weapons and spells are highly effective due to his 75% fire weakness, but his 95% frost resistance makes cold builds ineffective. His invisibility phases are punishing—you cannot maintain DPS during Vampiric Invisibility windows.

## The Defining Threat

**Drain Life Spam (Dual Absorption)**: Deals 75 health + magicka + stamina damage PER SECOND while he absorbs that damage as healing. A single 5-second cast heals him for 375 HP while draining you for 375 points across three attributes. This is self-healing + resource drain combined.

**Vampiric Drain (Secondary Absorption)**: 25 health damage to you + 15 health absorption per second to him. Lower damage than Drain Life but applies faster and has longer duration (up to 20s if uninterrupted).

**Triple Summons (Mandatory Tanking)**: Maintains Gargoyle (60s), Revenant (60s), and Reanimate Corpse (60s) simultaneously. Managing 4 targets (Harkon + 3 summons) means your damage is split across multiple threats. Summons tank damage while Harkon casts absorption spells.

**Vampiric Invisibility (20s Invulnerability)**: Becomes invisible for 20 seconds, ending all current damage application. DoTs tick during invisibility (poison works) but direct damage is lost. During invisibility, he regens stamina/magicka freely.

**Sanguine Vampiris Disease**: He carries this disease; spreads on hit. Infected characters take 1/s drain and lower all attributes by 10%. Manage infection status or accept stat penalties.

## Counter Strategies

1. **Fire Damage Build (Primary Counter)**:
   - Harkon has 75% fire weakness (takes 175% damage from fire)
   - Fire enchantments on weapons are 1.75x more effective
   - Fire spells deal amplified damage (1.75x base)
   - Combines with any penetration perks for total damage formula: Base × 1.75 × (1 - enemy resistances)
   - Recommended: Fire-enchanted melee or Fireball spam
   - Avoid frost (95% resistance makes it pointless)

2. **Poison + Attrition Stacking**:
   - Apply poisons that deal DoT damage (works during invisibility)
   - Poisons stack: multiple applications = multiple ticks
   - During invisibility, poison ticks 20 seconds uninterrupted
   - Combined with fire weapons: fire for direct damage, poison for invisibility phase damage
   - Requires sustained engagement (5+ min fights typical)

3. **Summon Focus (Eliminates Damage Spreading)**:
   - Kill summons immediately when summoned (Gargoyle first, low priority for later summons)
   - Each destroyed summon = 25-33% less incoming damage
   - Kills Harkon's tanking strategy
   - Risk: Focuses your damage away from Harkon, extending fight duration
   - Recommended only if your damage to Harkon is very low

4. **Resource Stacking + Restoration**:
   - He heals 75 HP/s from Drain Life; you need 100+ DPS to overcome
   - Use restoration spells or high-healing items to counter drain effects
   - Vampiric Invisibility is a 20s rest period for both of you; use it to heal/rebuff
   - Essentially converts to resource war (who has more total HP/stamina/magicka)
   - Works for high-healing builds (Restoration 100, multiple healing spells)

## Critical Mechanics

- **Dual Drain Absorption (75 health + magicka + stamina per second)**: Harkon heals while draining you; interrupting this spell is critical
- **Vampiric Invisibility (20s invisibility)**: Ends all combat engagement; DoTs continue but directional damage stops
- **Sanguine Vampiris Disease (1/s drain if infected)**: Lowers all attributes by 10; manage through restoration or disease cure
- **Poison Immunity (200 points)**: Base poison doesn't apply; only special poisons work
- **95% Frost Resistance**: Frost damage is nearly useless; avoid cold builds
- **75% Fire Weakness**: Fire damage is 1.75x effective; mandatory inclusion in build
- **1/s Health Regeneration**: Combined with drain life healing, his total healing can reach 76/s in optimal scenarios
- **Paralysis Immunity**: Cannot be crowd controlled via paralysis
- **Summon Duration (60s each)**: Up to 3 summons active simultaneously; re-summoning happens at end of duration
