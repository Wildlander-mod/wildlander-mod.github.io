## Miraak: First Dragonborn

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 LETHAL**
> 
> The first Dragonborn and Daedric servant. Miraak combines dragon shout expertise with master-level magic and extreme defensive capabilities (95% magic resistance, 1000% during Ethereal phase). Invulnerability phases are frequent and unavoidable. This fight requires specific counter-builds; standard approaches fail catastrophically.

## The Defining Threat

**Ethereal Invulnerability Phases**: Miraak casts "Ethereal" gaining 1000 armor rating and 1000% magic resistance (essentially complete immunity). These phases are mandatory waiting periods where NO damage can be applied—you must survive passively.

**Elemental Cloak + Weakness Application**: Applies 250% weakness to Frost, Fire, and Shock for 20 seconds while dealing 15/s elemental damage in melee. Your resistances become liabilities; every resist you have triggers harder damage.

**Knowledge Drain Spell**: Deals 150 Health + Magicka damage simultaneously with 75% magic weakness debuff. Stacks with Elemental Cloak weakness to create cascading vulnerability.

**Permanent Dragon Aspect**: Shout lasts 720 seconds (permanent for practical purposes). Armor +150, power attacks +75% damage, fire/frost resistance +25%, shout cooldown -20%. He gets stronger as fight progresses.

**Dual Summons**: Maintains 3 summons simultaneously (Twin Souls perk). Atronachs stay for extended duration; managing 4+ targets (Miraak + 3 summons) is mandatory.

## Counter Strategies

1. **Ethereal Phase Management (Primary Strategy)**:
   - Accept that 30-40% of the fight is waiting/surviving
   - Use Ethereal phases to reposition, recover stamina/magicka, apply buffs
   - DoT effects (poison, disease, lingering damage) tick during Ethereal—prep these
   - Summon your own creatures to maintain DPS while he's invulnerable
   - This is NOT a mistake or bug; plan around it

2. **Physical Melee Build (Tier 1 Counter)**:
   - Slashing/piercing resistance is only Tier 2 (low)
   - Miraak is armor-weak compared to magic—enchanted melee is effective
   - Two-hander builds face 45% damage reduction but deal high per-hit damage
   - Close quarters minimizes his spell range advantage
   - Requires tanking Knowledge Drain hits; use heavy armor + restoration

3. **Summon-Focused Build (Tier 2 Counter)**:
   - Summon atronachs or reanimated creatures
   - They tank his elemental damage (Elemental Cloak) while you DPS
   - Extended binding perks let you maintain summons longer than he does
   - Atronachs are immune to Bend Will and his summoning attempts
   - Essentially makes it a summoned creature vs summoned creature war

4. **Pure Ranged (High Difficulty)**:
   - His 95% magic resistance makes spellcasting ineffective
   - Bow damage is limited by Tier 3 ranged resistance (30%)
   - Requires extreme damage-per-shot builds with shock arrows
   - No recovery window during Ethereal phases; must maintain DPS tempo
   - Not recommended; melee or summons significantly better

## Critical Mechanics

- **1000% Magic Resistance (Ethereal)**: This is literal invulnerability; all spells deal 0 damage, including DoTs
- **75% Magic Weakness Debuff**: After Knowledge Drain hit, your magic damage is quartered for 5 seconds
- **Ancient Dragonborn Manifestation (<50% health)**: A second Miraak-like entity spawns to protect him, effectively doubling threat mid-fight
- **Restoration Healing (Respite Perk)**: His healing spells restore stamina—he has unlimited resource recovery
- **Poison Immunity (100%)**: Poison damage strategies are completely useless
- **Unrelenting Force/Bend Will Immunity**: Shout-based displacement/control won't work
- **Skill 100 Destruction**: His spells deal 100% more damage than base values
- **Spell Duration x5**: Any duration effects last 5 times longer than listed (40s becomes 200s, etc.)
