## Ebony Warrior: Champion of Oblivion

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 LETHAL**
> 
> The ultimate warrior—not a mage, not a stealth assassin, but pure martial excellence. 66% damage reduction stacks multiplicatively on ALL damage sources, making him effectively 3x as tanky as armor alone suggests. Combine this with stagger immunity, block absorption, and 5/s health regeneration, and you face an opponent who simply cannot be burst-damaged. Attrition is mandatory.

## The Defining Threat

**66% Damage Reduction (Multiplicative)**: This is the core mechanic that defines the Ebony Warrior fight. Every attack you land deals only 34% of its listed damage. This stacks WITH your armor penetration:
- 50% armor penetration → 50% × 34% = 17% effective damage
- 75% armor penetration → 75% × 34% = 25.5% effective damage
- Even with armor pen, you deal 1/4 to 1/3 normal damage

**Stagger Immunity**: You cannot interrupt him. Power attacks, bashes, stun effects—none of them break his animations. Waiting for an opening is pointless; they don't exist.

**Fortify Block (35%)**: His shield blocks 35% more damage than normal, effectively making his armor rating 35% higher for blocking purposes. Combined with 66% reduction, blocking is extremely effective.

**5/s Health Regeneration**: In a non-mage focused build, you might output 20-30 DPS. His regeneration means you barely outpace his healing. Fights routinely exceed 5+ minutes even with solid damage builds.

**Slashing Tier 5 Resistance (45%)**: Weapon damage is limited. Shock/Fire damage are lower tiers, making elemental enchantments more effective than pure physical slashing.

## Counter Strategies

1. **Elemental Enchantment Focus (Recommended)**:
   - Frost/Shock on weapons deal only ~35% reduced damage (vs 45% for slashing)
   - Damage = Base × 0.34 (global reduction) × 0.65 (elemental resistance)
   - Build multi-hit weapons: dual daggers, dual swords with fast attack speed
   - Spread damage across many hits to exceed 5/s regen
   - 20-30 enchantment damage per hit × 3-4 hits/second = 60-120 total DPS, beating his regen

2. **Attrition + Positioning Build**:
   - Accept the fight will last 5+ minutes
   - Use bow + melee rotation to maintain resource efficiency
   - Heavy armor + shield to survive his 40/s damage output (when hitting)
   - Focus on consistent 15-20 DPS rather than spike damage
   - Use summons to split his attention (he'll damage summon instead of you)
   - This is a war of attrition; whoever has more resources wins

3. **Pure Ranged (Bow) Build**:
   - Ranged Tier 4 resistance (30%) is slightly lower than melee
   - Requires 15+ damage per arrow to exceed regeneration
   - Shock arrows more effective than fire
   - Maintain 30+ feet distance to avoid his weapon damage (40/s)
   - Risk: If he closes distance, low armor rating becomes liability
   - Viable but requires high damage output and stamina management

4. **Restoration Focus Build (Healing DPS)**:
   - If you heal 30/s, he heals 5/s, net damage dealt is 25/s to HP
   - Requires focusing restoration magic or high-healing items
   - Converts fight into a mana/stamina vs stamina race
   - Less effective than raw DPS builds but viable for pure caster characters

## Critical Mechanics

- **66% Damage Reduction (Multiplicative with armor pen)**: This is NOT a mistake; it's THE defining mechanic of this fight
- **Stagger Immunity**: No crowd control, no interrupts, no windows—he attacks continuously
- **5/s Health Regeneration**: At Requiem's ~20-30 typical DPS, he only loses 15-25 net HP/s
- **Frost/Shock Resistance (95%)**: Elemental resistance is extreme; shock is marginally better than frost but both are heavily resisted
- **Standard AR (1290)**: With armor cap system, this is near-maximum protection; penetration is essential
- **Bull Rush (Knock Down)**: He can knock you down; you cannot knock him down
- **Two-Handed Weapon + Two-Handed Skill 100**: His damage is +100% from base; expect 40/s effective damage per hit
- **Poison/Paralysis Immunity**: DoT and crowd control strategies are completely useless
