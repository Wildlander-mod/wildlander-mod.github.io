Automatons are constructs of dwarven origin and can most often be found in dwemer ruins. Those encountered in Skyrim seem to be magically operated, as soul gems can be found in their remains, but how they function as a whole remains a secret. In general, they all share a strong resistance to physical damage due to their massive metal bodies, but can be dispatched relatively easily with shock based spells and enchantments, probably because they disrupt the magic that animates them.
They are golden colored, strong robotic creations made by the Dwemer.

### Dwarven Spider

{: .hint}
> **Threat Level: 🟢 Average**
> 
> Smallest automaton type with low health (162-200) and melee damage (20). However, fast (speed 130) and may have active lightning crystal dealing 85 damage. Low threat individually but dangerous in swarms. Shock spells are effective.

The weakest form of dwarven automatons. Shaped like a spider, they're also the smallest of constructs encountered. However, they are even faster than the Spheres and sometimes have an active crystal mounted on their top that is capable of producing lethal strikes of lightning. When approaching in large numbers, it is highly advised to either flee or make use of spells that damage multiple ones.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Low health makes them disposable; prioritize if in groups
* Their lightning attack (85 damage) is their only real threat
* Use shock magic to reduce healing further and disable active variants
* Very high weapon resistance (Tier 5); use shock spells or blunt magic
* In swarms, use AoE attacks to manage multiple targets

### Dwarven Sphere

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 Difficult**
> 
> Medium-tier automaton with dual combat capability (melee + crossbow). Moderate health (293-650 depending on variant) and balanced damage output. High armor (420) with Tier 5 weapon resistance requires shock magic or armor-piercing attacks. Crossbow can attack from range while melee engages.

A less durable form of the dwarven automatons, the dwarven sphere is more common than the centurion. However, it's much faster and can maneuver much better than the former - most often, they are still patrolling in the more narrow sections of the dwarven ruins. They're generally equipped with a melee weapon and a crossbow, allowing them to either engage in close combat or attack from afar.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* Dual combat threat: anticipate both melee and ranged attacks
* Crossbow damage (60 + 84 ammo) is moderate but consistent
* High armor (420) and weapon resistance—use shock spells or magic
* Malfunctioning variant (445 health) is slightly stronger than standard (650)
* Keep distance from crossbow variants; close quickly if low on defenses

### Dwarven Ballista

{: .warning}
> **Threat Level: 🟡 Difficult**
> 
> Pure artillery platform with devastating ranged attack (128 base + 84 bolt + 45 AP = extremely high), stagger capability, and high armor penetration (75 AP). Very dangerous at range; close melee engagement is key strategy. Will prioritize distance for maximum reload time. Shock magic effective.

Ballistae are ranged attackers that will make every effort to stay as far away from their targets as possible and assail them with high-power ballista bolts from a distance. Their attacks are particularly powerful, will stagger those they hit. For this reason, they are high priority targets to remove as soon as possible whenever they are encountered. An effective strategy for combating them is to stay at range and evade their attack, and then rush them and attempt to defeat them before they have a chance to reload their ballista bolt.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* **Highest ranged threat**: Each shot deals ~250+ damage and staggers—dodge aggressively
* Rush them immediately; don't allow reload cycles
* Use shock magic to interrupt or disable them
* High armor penetration (75 AP) means heavy armor is less protective—plan accordingly
* Once at melee range, they become less dangerous; finish before they reposition

### Dwarven Centurion

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 Dangerous**
> 
> Pinnacle Dwemer creation with massive health (3100), extreme armor (900), and devastating melee damage (300). Steam breath attack applies 150 damage. Weapon resistance is extreme (Tier 5 + reductions, 75% blunt reduction). Shock magic is THE counter—use it or face attrition death. Knockdown-immune.

The Centurion is one of the greatest inventions of dwemic craftmanship and proves to be a very dangerous foe. It's massive metal body provides an exceptional protection from all forms of physical damage and is unpenetrable by common arrows, making unenchanted bows practically useless and turning every melee fight into a very long lasting encounter. It's only weakness seems to be electric energy, as the exposure to such seems to overcharge the construct and thereby destroying the magical mechanisms that keep it running. However, some if not all of them have the ability to shoot forth streams of hot steam that can cook human-like creatures alive. If one wants to approach them in melee combat, it's most likely suicide if the daredevil does not use some sort of fire protection.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* **Use shock magic or don't engage**: Unenchanted weapons are nearly useless
* Steam breath (150 damage) requires fire resistance or healing
* Blunt weapons suffer 75% damage reduction; slashing/piercing also heavily penalized
* Physical armor offers little protection; dodge and use magic
* Extremely high armor penetration (75 AP) means armor rating is negated anyway
* This is a magic fight, not a melee fight—prepare accordingly

### The Forgemaster

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 Dangerous (Lethal)**
> 
> Boss-tier automaton twice as dangerous as standard Centurion. Extremely high health (6000), fire immunity, and devastating fire breath (200/s for 3 seconds). Fire Cloak passive applies 20/s melee damage. Extreme armor (900) with same weapon resistance penalties. Shock magic effective but challenge is raw damage output required to overcome 6000 HP. This is a legendary encounter.

The Forgemaster is a powerful Dwarven Centurion that guards the Aetherium Forge. The Forgemaster is slightly larger in size than normal Centurions, still appearing partially molten due to its long slumber in the lava, and breathes a gout of fire instead of steam. The fire it breathes will also linger on the ground for some time, causing low-medium fire damage.

**Quick Tactical Tips**
* **Fire immunity**: All fire damage and enchantments are useless
* **Fire breath** (200/s for 3s): This is your primary survival concern—high fire resistance essential
* Fire Cloak (20/s in melee): Staying at distance is mandatory
* Shock magic is still the answer but requires sustained damage
* Extreme health (6000) means long fights; prepare for endurance
* Consider this a boss fight, not a regular encounter—bring your best gear
* Multiple targets (if encountered) are instantly lethal; do not engage multiple Forgemasters

### Enchanted Sphere

{: .important}
> **Threat Level: 🔴 Dangerous**
> 
> High-tier hybrid automaton with **health regeneration (60/s) as THE defining threat**—shock slows it to 20/s but does NOT stop it. Requires sustained damage exceeding 20/s to overcome regeneration. Combined with escalating poison weapon (2/s x 60s, weakens poison defenses 50%), shock crossbow (234 damage), and extreme armor (900). This is an attrition fight requiring specific counter strategies.

A much more Larger, rarer form of the Dwarven Sphere, and much more dangerous. It's massive metal body provides an exceptional protection from all forms of physical damage and is unpenetrable by common arrows, coupled with health regeneration which is only slowed by electirical discharges. It's weapon is coated in a powerful toxin which deals ever increasing damage per hit. Its crossbow is enchanted with shock damage.

**Counter Strategies**

1. **Sustained Shock Spam**: Keep shock spells casting continuously (Shock, Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning) to slow regen to 20/s, then add physical damage to exceed regen. This is the primary counter—without continuous shock, the fight is unwinnable.

2. **Shock-Enchanted Melee**: Use shock-enchanted weapons (or Dawnguard Stalhrim weapons) to apply shock while dealing damage. Allows melee engagement while maintaining regen slowdown. Requires poison immunity or heavy poison resistance.

3. **Ranged Attrition from Distance**: Stay at range, use shock spells to slow regen, manage the shock crossbow threat (234 damage per shot). Avoid melee entirely to prevent poison escalation. Requires high magic stamina/magicka recovery and shock spell spam capability.

**Tactical Warnings**

* **Pure archer cannot engage this solo**—you MUST have shock magic or enchants and be able to counter the health regeneration, take some followers.
* **Poison weapon is a secondary threat** that escalates with each hit—absolutely use poison immunity potion before melee engagement
* **Shock crossbow (234 damage)** is consistent threat while you're attacking; position carefully and keep moving so you can dodge
* **Magical Absorb (30% in most locations)** further reduces spell damage—use highest-tier shock spells
* Long fights demand resource management; if you are a caster bring magicka potions or prep Respite perks, for everyone else potions - Cure poison is helpful in addition to the usual supply of health, fortify and stamina potions.

For any adventure foolish enough to take one on, poison and shock resistance is therefore a must, along with shock enchanted blunt weaponry to reduce its healing.
