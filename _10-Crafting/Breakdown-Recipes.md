## What is Breakdown Crafting?

Breakdown crafting allows you to deconstruct items into their component materials. This is a great way to recover valuable resources from unwanted gear and manage your inventory more efficiently.

**Default Hotkey:** Press the bracket key `?` to open the breakdown menu while holding an item, or access it through any crafting workstation.

### Examples

- **Armor** → Metal fragments, leather straps, bones, teeth
- **Clothing** → Fabric, Threads
- **Bones & Teeth** → Bone fragments
- **Wooden Items** → Kindling (for starting fires and campfires)

**Tip:** Breakdown crafting is excellent for managing carry weight by converting bulky items into compact materials.
