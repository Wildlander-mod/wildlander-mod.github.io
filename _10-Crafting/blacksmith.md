## Metal Weapon and Armor Crafting

Forge weapons and metal armor at a **Blacksmith Forge** workstation. Create the backbone of your combat effectiveness through metalworking.

**Available crafting includes:**
- Weapon creation (swords, axes, maces, daggers, etc.)
- Metal armor pieces (helm, cuirass, gauntlets, boots, etc.)
- Specialized combat gear
- Unique metal items

**Tip:** Blacksmithing is one of the most important crafts in Requiem. Invest in this skill early to create better gear as you progress.
