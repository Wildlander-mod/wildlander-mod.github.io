## Jewelry and Gem Crafting

Create and customize jewelry using the **Forge** workstation. This toolkit allows you to combine precious metals and gems into valuable accessories. Combining Gems and jewelry is performed from player crafting and no longer grants XP.

**Available crafting includes:**
- Ring creation and customization
- Amulet and pendant crafting
- Gem setting and stone working
- Precious metal jewelry

**Tip:** Jewelry crafting generates excellent XP and creates items valuable for trading and bartering with merchants.
