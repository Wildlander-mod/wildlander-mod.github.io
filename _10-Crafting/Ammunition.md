## Arrow and Projectile Crafting

Craft arrows and bolts for ranged weapons at a **Blacksmith Forge**. Essential for archers and crossbow users.

**Available crafting includes:**
- Arrow creation (iron, steel, daedric, ebony, etc.)
- Bolt crafting for crossbows
- Specialized projectiles

**Tip:** Archers should regularly craft ammunition to maintain a steady supply. Ammunition is lightweight and can be crafted quickly for good XP.
