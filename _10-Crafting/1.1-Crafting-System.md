## Crafting System Overview

Version 1.1 introduced new items called toolkits. These toolkits serve a dual purpose: they act as a mechanic for accessing crafting from your inventory by using the item directly, and they filter the crafting menu when using crafting workstations or player crafting.

It also brought back player crafting (accessed by pressing Right Shift by default), which lets you use multiple workstations while standing nearby without having to interact with them. This prevents the bug where switching workstations too quickly would prevent you from gaining XP.

The main benefits of the toolkits and player crafting system are:

1. **Direct Inventory Access** - Use toolkits directly from your inventory as filters (e.g., "I only want to see Alchemy items")
2. **Prevents Crashes** - Scrolling rapidly through large crafting menus can cause crashes. Toolkits filter the menu to prevent this
3. **Logical Recipe Placement** - Recipes are now where they make sense. You don't need a forge to make clothing, so clothing recipes are in Player Crafting only
4. **Smaller Lists** - Reduced visual clutter. Player Crafting only shows your toolkits, and expanding a toolkit only shows related recipes
5. **No Hotkey Triggers** - Filtering from the crafting menu no longer accidentally triggers other hotkeys
6. **Class-Appropriate Filtering** - Warrior characters won't see Tailoring items and vice versa (unless you expand the toolkit)

Changes from mod defaults:
* For those veteran Requiem players, The Smithing Book to learn perks setting is Off.
* Amulet's on Backpack recipes are disabled.

## Quick Start: Getting Your First Toolkits

**Early Game Progression:**

1. **Basic Toolkits (Requires Craftmanship perk)** - Easiest to craft
   - Toolkit: Alchemist's - 2 Wood
   - Toolkit: Brewer's - 2 Wood
   - Toolkit: Survivalist's - 2 Wood
   - Toolkit: Tailor's - 2 Wood

2. **Intermediate Toolkits** - Requires a Steel Ingot + 2 Wood + Craftmanship
   - Toolkit: Builder's
   - Toolkit: Chef's
   - Toolkit: Jeweller's
   - Toolkit: Smith's
   - Toolkit: Thieves'

**Recommendation:** Start with the Alchemist's or Survivalist's toolkit for early game utility, then progress to the Smith's toolkit when you have steel ingots.

## Player Crafting vs Workstations: When to Use Each

**Player Crafting (Right Shift):**
- Use this for recipes that don't require a workstation (like basic crafting)
- Useful when multiple workstations are nearby—you can access them all without switching
- Prevents XP bugs from rapid workstation switching
- Great for on-the-fly crafting while exploring

**Workstations:**
- Required for specialized crafting: Alchemy tables, Enchanting tables, Armor workstations, Sharpening wheels
- Use when you only need one specific workstation
- Some new portable workstations available: Mortar & Pestle, Enchanting Supplies, Spinning Wheel, Portable Tanning Rack, Alembic & Cauldron, Portable Cook-pot

In addition there are several new workstations available:
- **Mortar and Pestle** - Portable alchemy table for creating potions in the field
- **Enchanting Supplies** - Portable enchanting table (requires bonemeal to use)
- **Spinning Wheel** - Placeable workstation for crafting cloth and thread
- **Portable Tanning Rack** - Mobile tanning station
- **Alembic and Cauldron** - Workstations for use with the Spell Research mod
- **Portable Cook-pot** - Requires a player-created campfire 

## Smelting

To Smelt ores or fragments into bars, you now need the material perk for the recipe.

E.g You need Ebony Smithing to make Ebony ingots.

For gold and Silver, you need Advanced Blacksmithing.

## XP Gain from Crafting Items

Complete Crafting Overhaul introduces a new XP calculation method designed to reward **experimentation and variety** over repetition. The formula encourages crafting a wide range of different items rather than spamming the same one.

**Note:** When crafting stacks of items (e.g., 15 Arrows), the stack multiplies the item value by the quantity, and each stack counts as 1 craft. It's more XP-efficient to craft 3 stacks of 100 nails than 300 individual nails.

### XP Formula

**New XP Gain = Part 1 + Part 2**

**Part 1** = (VanillaXP × VanillaXPModifier × SmithingXPBonus)

**Part 2** = (((ItemValue / 3) × BonusMult) ^ BonusExp) × NumCraftedMultiplier

Where:
- **VanillaXP** = 3 × item value^0.65 + 25
- **VanillaXPModifier** = 1
- **BonusMult** (Bonus Multiplier) = 53
- **BonusExp** (Bonus Exponent) = 0.5
- **NumCraftedMultiplier** = 3 (1st craft), 2 (2nd craft), 1 (3rd craft), 0 (4th+ craft)
  - *After crafting an item 3 times, Part 2 becomes zero, so no more bonus XP*

### SmithingXPBonus Calculation

Your crafting XP is boosted based on buffs and perks:

- **Unfathomable Depths quest completed** = +1.15 bonus
- **Well Rested (married)** = +1.15 bonus
- **Well Rested** = +1.10 bonus
- **Rested** = +1.05 bonus
- **Base** = 1.0

Additionally:
- **Warrior Stone** = +0.2 bonus
- **Lover Stone** = +0.15 bonus

## XP Gain from Tempering Items

Tempering XP is unchanged from Vanilla. The formula below is from UESP:

**ΔXP = 3.8 × Δitem value^0.5 × ΔQ^0.5**

Where:
- **Δitem value** = the amount the item's gold value increased from improvement
- **ΔQ** = quality number (0 = No Improvement, 1 = Well-made, 2 = High Grade, etc.)

**Note:** Delta value is used instead of item value because enchanted item multipliers don't work consistently with absolute values.
